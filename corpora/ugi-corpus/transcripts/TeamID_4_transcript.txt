7.691:>>Person1>> it looks like some items
10.911:>>Person3>>so did we want to just go through the items and kinda then gave 
15.884:>>Person3>>give what we placed them at
18.905:>>Person3>>like say like box of matches and say everyone give their number just to give a rough idea 
18.905:>>Person3>>yeah just to see where we are at
27.859:>>Person3>>so box of matches 
27.859:>>Person3>>I put as fourteen
28.00:>>Person2>>fifteen
29.900:>>Person3>>I put as thirteen
33.833:>>Person4>>yeah I also 
34.987:>>Person3>>that's a low ranking 
37.643:>>Person2>> pretty low ranking one
39.625:>>Person3>>%HESITATION food concentrate 
42.365:>>Person1>>I 
43.638:>>Person1>>I put as five
44.473:>>Person3>>I I did nine
47.608:>>Person4>>three
48.3:>>Person2>>I gave it a nine too
49.403:>>Person3>>so we are kind of split 
51.797:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the rope 
51.797:>>Person3>>I put eight 
55.158:>>Person2>>I put I gave it an eight as well
58.179:>>Person1>>I put six 
59.11:>>Person4>> five
61.155:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the parachute silk
64.954:>>Person1>> I put seven
66.687:>>Person3>>I put thirteen 
69.081:>>Person2>>I gave this a twelve
71.07:>>Person3>>a twelve okay 
72.607:>>Person4>>well I also gave a twelve
72.689:>>Person2>> okay
75.974:>>Person3>>%HESITATION heating unit I gave a seven 
79.563:>>Person2>>I gave it a three
79.714:>>Person3>>okay 
81.323:>>Person1>>I also gave it a three
84.157:>>Person4>> I gave it a six
87.142:>>Person3>>okay the two forty five caliber pistol 
88.671:>>Person4>>fifteen
89.9:>>Person4>>fifteen
91.1:>>Person2>>fourteen
92.856:>>Person3>>I have put ten we can discuss reason why later 
98.12:>>Person3>>yeah okay %HESITATION will the case of dehydrated milk I have given eleven 
98.12:>>Person4>>seven
99.10:>>Person1>>four
102.3:>>Person2>>ten
108.858:>>Person3>>%HESITATION okay split I will get to it its okay
111.339:>>Person3>>%HESITATION a hundred pounds of oxygen I put number one 
115.856:>>Person4>>one 
116.042:>>Person1>>I put also one 
117.014:>>Person3>>okay 
117.014:>>Person3>>so check it out one right %HESITATION 
117.731:>>Person1>>survival is the priority
121.243:>>Person1>>everybody reach consensus center that it is number one
123.46:>>Person3>>yeah okay we can just turn on the the group ranking the stellar map I put a six 
124.335:>>Person1>> eight
124.373:>>Person4>>ten
132.241:>>Person2>>I gave it a eleven
133.09:>>Person3>> okay
134.567:>>Person3>>kinda already there
136.17:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the life raft I give a twelve 
138.17:>>Person3>>%HESITATION I also gave it a twelve 
141.448:>>Person4>>four 
142.5:>>Person2>>I gave it a two
143.173:>>Person3>>okay and that was fun we will talk about it
146.059:>>Person3>>all right magnetic compass I give a five 
150.395:>>Person4>>eleven 
153.5:>>Person4>>fourteen 
155.695:>>Person4>>seven
156.009:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the five gallons of water I give a three 
162.09:>>Person4>>two
162.94:>>Person2>>two
164.0:>>Person1>>four
165.94:>>Person2>>so yeah it is a high priority
166.354:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the signal flares I gave a fifteen 
170.504:>>Person4>>fourteen
171.985:>>Person1>>nine
172:>>Person2>>six
173.536:>>Person3>>okay 
175.626:>>Person3>>the first aid kit I give four 
176.504:>>Person4>>nine
178.985:>>Person1>>eleven
179:>>Person2>>thirteen
182.123:>>Person3>>okay so kind on the lower 
185.028:>>Person3>>we'll get 
187.114:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the solar powered FM receiver 
189:>>Person3>>eight
192.941:>>Person3>>I put two 
195.402:>>Person1>>I put ten but then but I was thinking it might be very necessary for communication
200.369:>>Person3>>yeah that that's what I put it as like kind of like that's how we're going to talk but then also I honestly don't entirely know what it is 
208.817:>>Person1>>so I was thinking about the distance two hundred miles is too long for the communication but it is necessary if we reach at a proximity
219.678:>>Person3>>of a certain point yeah okay okay yeah that makes sense 
219.678:>>Person3>>sort of like yeah okay that makes sense so yeah I we could shifted down but it's still kind of the higher up right 
219.678:>>Person3>>I I'll let me just get to my 
219.678:>>Person3>>the pistols this is what I thought okay I don't know if they were loaded or not but I assumed if you fired in space it could just
219.923:>>Person1>>float
219.984:>>Person3>>push you back
220.071:>>Person1>>yeah 
221.975:>>Person2>>oh as a thrust
222.132:>>Person3>>I was just trying to use it as a mode of transportation 
247.13:>>Person3>>I don't know if it actually work 
247.186:>>Person1>> thats right
247.213:>>Person4>>I don't 
247.246:>>Person2>>I don't know if 
248.512:>>Person4>>yeah I think you need combustion to fire a gun right
251.421:>>Person3>>I have I don't know I thought it 
254.648:>>Person4>>I don't feel like a gun would fire 
257.675:>>Person4>>I don't know I don't know about 
257.748:>>Person3>>I don't I don't know but I'm just saying 
261.444:>>Person3>>I mean like a forty five caliber pistol is a beefy hand gun  
266.107:>>Person3>>it's one of the most powerful handgun so that could
270.286:>>Person1>>if it fires safe 
273.425:>>Person1>>so there is actually two point if let's assume it fires so we have two options either it will propel us in a certain direction and the other another thing is how much force it will generate
286.445:>>Person1>>if it generates too much force it might propel us out of control
289.914:>>Person3>>oooh that's a good yeah that's the good point so yeah I'm I'm willing to sacrifice and it's not even guaranteed it will work
290.769:>>Person1>>but in conjunction with the nylon rope it might work
300.657:>>Person1>>for example 
302.167:>>Person2>>oh you could tie
302.329:>>Person1>>everybody's tied up by the rope and fired the gun maybe all of the people 
306.89:>>Person3>>yeah yeah 
306.962:>>Person4>>yeah 
306.964:>>Person2>>yeah 
309.108:>>Person3>>see I would I put the rope 
309.108:>>Person3>>%HESITATION given that like we are taking five gallons of water if we are taking all these stuff we're not gonna want to carry you kind of want to tie it up and then drag 
319.756:>>Person4>>my logic was we have the life raft and we put everything in there raft and 
324.529:>>Person3>>%HESITATION aah I didnt even consider that yeah that makes some 
324.639:>>Person2>>yeah 
325.095:>>Person1>> yeah
328.446:>>Person3>>okay 
328.446:>>Person3>>okay that makes sense yeah I'm to be honest I don't really know what to do with life rafts of of the ten twenty and then ran out of space 
328.565:>>Person4>>that's why I ranked %HESITATION 
328.596:>>Person3>>to be honest I didn't really know what to do with life rafts so I put them towards the end
335.36:>>Person4>>I just thought that two one hundred tanks are pretty bulky I feel like I should drag them instead of carry them
338.302:>>Person3>>yeah 
340.674:>>Person3>>no no no okay yeah okay so 
340.674:>>Person3>>%HESITATION so we get the hundred Tanks 
346.89:>>Person3>>so what are we thinking our next we have a high on
351.096:>>Person3>>the gallons of water 
353.543:>>Person4>>what did you what was your gallons of water
356.572:>>Person3>>I put at three 
357.222:>>Person4>>what did you put before that
359.34:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the receiver as I assume 
361.744:>>Person2>>oh the receiver
363.569:>>Person3>>so 
363.599:>>Person1>>it's a very 
364.99:>>Person3>>I mean survival should be one and then try to get 
366.911:>>Person1>>so 
370.04:>>Person3>>okay so that makes sense so should we put 
373.3:>>Person3>>so if we're thinking in terms of survival than 
373.3:>>Person3>>the gallons of milk I mean water 
377.524:>>Person4>>%HESITATION the food 
379.435:>>Person3>>the food 
381.444:>>Person3>>the rope and the life raft  
383.167:>>Person2>>and my guess is of a portable heading into %HESITATION should be considered because %HESITATION those are temperatures that are very low yeah and at such low temperatures everything else actually starts freezing because five gallons of water would mean nothing to you if it's pretty cold
395.74:>>Person3>>well yeah actually I didn't even consider that yeah 
399.184:>>Person2>>yeah and at such low temperatures like inside the life raft then they'll be a lot of dew formation and that leads to short circuits inside 
406.481:>>Person2>>and that's a pretty dangerous
407.717:>>Person3>>okay 
408.873:>>Person3>>alright
409.98:>>Person1>>well what about the Steller map would it help for guidance 
414.883:>>Person4>>I wasn't sure
416.092:>>Person3>>I I didn't know I assume and I honestly don't know the mechanics of a compass if that would even work on 
423.744:>>Person4>>yeah I wasn't sure about that he 
426.298:>>Person2>>yeah 
427.183:>>Person3>>on a on the moon 
427.511:>>Person1>>in earth having a magnetic compass makes sense because of the magnetic field
427.558:>>Person2>>yeah 
431.24:>>Person1>>the 
432.274:>>Person3>>I think yeah yeah but I didn't 
432.274:>>Person3>>I have no idea 
432.365:>>Person1>>yeah but do have magnetic field in moon 
435.809:>>Person2>>it's pretty weak yeah it's kind of pointless yeah okay so yeah 
439.84:>>Person3>>okay so yeah we can throw out the magetic compass then
442.435:>>Person2>>especially if we have the signal flares and if we have the solar power transmitter I think these are good enough to get to where we want
448.275:>>Person3>>that 
449.332:>>Person1>>but one thing to consider is a signal flare will it need oxygen to fire 
454.776:>>Person3>>so is that kinda like the gun scenario 
456.148:>>Person4>>but also what would we like whose attention would we be trying to get with the flares like it we are assuming that there is somebody at the location we are trying to get to
456.22:>>Person2>> I think
464.548:>>Person2>>that's the kind of an assumption because the transfer to there also is pointless if there's no body there
464.548:>>Person2>>yeah I 
465.164:>>Person3>>one of them can because that's what also 
470.766:>>Person4>>yeah I feel I was assuming no one was there okay but that makes a lot of sense
473.907:>>Person3>>yeah so yeah 
477.21:>>Person1>>let's assume that somebody is there on the mother ship
479.871:>>Person3>>yeah okay 
481.949:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
483.684:>>Person3>>so we could 
485.311:>>Person3>>so the five priorities I have right now are the water life raft the heating unit rope and food concentrate
492.394:>>Person3>>so 
492.748:>>Person1>>what about the dehydrated milk
493.424:>>Person1>> can it be considered as food or
497.762:>>Person3>>I think it would be I mean yeah that's a little  
499.623:>>Person4>>its not much of nutritional value
499.753:>>Person2>>I mean both would go hand in hand 
502.42:>>Person3>>yeah 
502.857:>>Person1>>but it is not a fundamental for survival I like 
506.159:>>Person3>>yeah I feel like food concentrate would take over and they said that 
506.389:>>Person4>>right 
506.424:>>Person2>>I like food and some yeah 
509.052:>>Person2>>unless you are like there for days and days and yeah 
510.518:>>Person3>>yeah and then you have to dig in 
510.672:>>Person1>> looking at the 
512.288:>>Person1>>chart it seems that some of the items can be grouped into the certain category maybe if we can 
514.587:>>Person4>>hmm hmm
520.535:>>Person1>>divide our priorities into categories can be easier for us for us to rank
521.838:>>Person3>>yeah
526.626:>>Person1>>one category is survival second category 
532.249:>>Person1>>is being able to reach the destination
533.948:>>Person3>>okay 
534.863:>>Person1>>so according to the first category survival we can rank
538.623:>>Person1>>some items 
540.259:>>Person3>> okay
540.414:>>Person2>>the most urgent ones
540.72:>>Person1>>then we can go to the next ones
543.489:>>Person3>>so yes so you wanna 
543.584:>>Person1>>but in that case I think 
546.596:>>Person1>>we have to interleave 
549.125:>>Person1>>two priorities because survival in terms of survival
552.765:>>Person1>>oxygen is most important right we need to breathe
556.509:>>Person1>>but also we have to have some sort of mechanism 
556.707:>>Person1>>to reach the destination in the shortest possible time
563.398:>>Person1>>so
566.55:>>Person3>>like this isn't going to be a comfortable hike so there's going to be times when we're going to have to not eat
569.028:>>Person1>>yeah 
572.427:>>Person3>>you know what I mean we are gonna have to eat sparingly in order to
573.908:>>Person2>>yeah 
575.041:>>Person2>>yeah 
577.176:>>Person1>>another thing that I am thinking about traveling on the moon
579.848:>>Person1>>how much what should be the duration between each rest interval
580.253:>>Person3>>yeah
583.934:>>Person1>>so in in moon
586.473:>>Person3>>yeah %HESITATION 
588.498:>>Person1>>would we be more tired
591.628:>>Person1>>be able to travel for longer without feeling the necessity to rest
597.057:>>Person2>>I feel like two hundred miles is not too large a distance I mean even if it even if the life raft goes at a speed of ten miles an hour
597.402:>>Person2>>which is not bad
604.981:>>Person2>>I think I think it's it's a matter of a few hours
605.829:>>Person3>>yeah 
611.102:>>Person2>>even twenty hours so I don't think they have I need I don't think we need 
614.505:>>Person1>>I think I think oxygen is mainly necessary for survival
615.015:>>Person3>>we don't need any 
617.004:>>Person1>>but the next steps should be the navigational equipments
617.184:>>Person2>>yeah 
624.603:>>Person2>>I think the life raft would come under both survival and where we want to get so I think that goes just as high as the oxygen
628.7:>>Person1>>yeah 
633.396:>>Person3>>okay so you want to second yeah I think they 
634.358:>>Person2>>only that might be a second 
636.83:>>Person2>>yeah I I 
636.864:>>Person1>>yeah I think I life raft is really useful because we can use it as a 
641.198:>>Person3>>yeah 
641.953:>>Person1>> tarnsportation
643.411:>>Person3>>and shelter
643.541:>>Person1>> I think it should be two
644.934:>>Person4>>what do you rank water after that then 
648.541:>>Person1>> water yeah may be
651.492:>>Person2>>we have probably life raft is like a necessity 
656.68:>>Person2>>water we would have to keep it inside 
659.722:>>Person1>>yeah
661.078:>>Person2>>probably life raft would go first
663.752:>>Person3>>and so life raft and then we will go with water okay 
668.598:>>Person1>>so life raft two water three 
668.685:>>Person3>>the water 
668.685:>>Person3>>yeah we'll see water three okay 
670.607:>>Person1>> okay thats a progress
676.175:>>Person1>>%HESITATION ohh portable heating unit
680.807:>>Person1>>maybe we can put it four 
682.374:>>Person4>>yeah if we do need that to keep the water drinkable 
684.143:>>Person3>>yeah 
686.562:>>Person2>>yeaah
686.564:>>Person3>>that's fair
688.852:>>Person3>>yeah we have already got this natural stacking going which is good 
692.725:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
693.944:>>Person1>>oh we forgot about the food and the
697.799:>>Person3>>so we just go food concentrate at this point now 
699.96:>>Person2>>there's a food concentrate and that might last much longer it's a concentrate
701.169:>>Person1>>what about what about
701.342:>>Person3>>yeah exactly 
703.974:>>Person1>>what about food concentrate and a solar powered FM receiver transmitter
707.918:>>Person1>>maybe we can choose
713.087:>>Person3>>I mean yet technically 
713.087:>>Person3>>basic 
716.746:>>Person3>>and a biology would water obviously and
719.594:>>Person3>>the the the food concentrate but so 
722.498:>>Person2>>you might last like for a couple of days 
726.672:>>Person3>>so do we want to go that power receiver first before the food concentrate on what we found 
732.652:>>Person4>>I'm just not sure how effectively the crew can move in the right direction if they weren't eating
740.044:>>Person3>>okay that's 
740.044:>>Person3>>actually valid point yeah indeed we need energy
745.984:>>Person3>>so we just do food concentrate then 
748.668:>>Person3>>then the receiver 
750.856:>>Person2>>we have probably we could we could do without the dehydrated milk 
754.896:>>Person3>>yeah that's what I was thinking we can kind of put that on the rug okay 
759.284:>>Person3>>so five for concentrate 
759.284:>>Person3>>and then six for the FM receiver 
770.262:>>Person3>>um what did we have for 
774.907:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the rope I didn't know we have a split 
777.234:>>Person4>>I think I think we need the rope to effectively move the life raft thats our point
780.89:>>Person3>>because then we would be just pushing
785.256:>>Person1>> I think yeah rope is necessary
787.678:>>Person1>>maybe we can engineer the parachute silk in some way to extend the life raft capability
796.324:>>Person3>>yeah 
798.142:>>Person1>>its just a piece of cloth assuming
799.146:>>Person3>> hmm hmm
801.323:>>Person1>>and I think 
801.323:>>Person1>>we can use the first aid kit containing injection needles in case we need to tear the parachute silk
810.561:>>Person3>>%HESITATION ohh its like stitched or something yeah 
810.929:>>Person1>>it's because first aid kit might not be necessary for our healing
811.13:>>Person4>>yeah yeah 
811.269:>>Person2>>yeah yeah 
813.952:>>Person3>>like 
815.76:>>Person1>>maybe we're not getting injured and will be inside astraunaut suit
817.997:>>Person3>>yeah 
821.716:>>Person1>>so it doesn't make sense to have the first aid kit for us but the tools inside the kit might help us to engineer different things
823.09:>>Person3>>okay 
834.561:>>Person3>>so in terms of next steps we are at six we have jump to seven 
839.258:>>Person3>> uhh 
841.956:>>Person3>>so what do we have left
843.593:>>Person4>>we're just yeah 
844.085:>>Person3>>so we have the ropes and the first aid
844.42:>>Person3>>okay 
846.866:>>Person4>>ropes and the first aid
852.279:>>Person3>>would are we thinking first rope or the life raft I think for 
854.833:>>Person1>>I think I think yeah I think for rope fifty feet it is very long
861.036:>>Person1>>we might need to cut it
863.32:>>Person3>>okay
863.53:>>Person2>>fifty feet
864.296:>>Person1>>I think we can go seven for the rope
866.239:>>Person3>>okay I'm I'm agreeing with it 
872.231:>>Person1>>then I am not sure about silk and the needles
875.365:>>Person4>>I feel like silk would be easy to tear so I would probably rank the needles above the silk
879.465:>>Person3>>yeah 
881.111:>>Person1>>oh okay so yeah so the needles might be used in other purpose also
884.239:>>Person4>> hmm
884.547:>>Person3>>so 
885.535:>>Person2>>yeah and you can knit the silk much more easily than the nylon rope 
889.812:>>Person3>>yeah 
890.929:>>Person3>>so we do in the 
893.078:>>Person3>>I'm sorry the needles right 
893.684:>>Person4>>needles
895.9:>>Person1>>eight needles
