2.507:>>Person3>>okay so what do you guys say is most important
6.277:>>Person2>>oxygen
7.203:>>Person1>>yeah ranked oxygen as number one 
9.932:>>Person3>>I had I had that at number two I had heating but oxygen makes sense because we need to breathe 
14.703:>>Person1>>so you you had oxygen as number you said
15.923:>>Person3>>I had number two I put the heater number one just because I know I think the moon gets cold and that was my reasoning
17.716:>>Person1>>okay
24.316:>>Person1>>I think my reasoning I went like what would kill you fastest so like first you'll die from no oxygen then from there okay so %HESITATION so we agree that one 
25.258:>>Person3>>oxygen and breathings
28.312:>>Person2>>hahaha
28.328:>>Person3>>yeah 
33.135:>>Person3>>okay 
34.597:>>Person2>>so one
34.712:>>Person3>>I agree with one yeah
38.217:>>Person1>>okay
38.885:>>Person2>>and for two I went again to the next thing that is going to kill you which was water like thirst 
42.928:>>Person1>>that's what I did yeah 
45.037:>>Person1>>thirst three days I think
45.159:>>Person4>>same
47.001:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
48.765:>>Person3>>I have water %HESITATION as three %HESITATION
54.751:>>Person3>>I put the heater just because I felt like it could get cold really quick
59.148:>>Person1>>%HESIATION I have a question about the heater on on the moon I don't know what the atmosphere of the moon is like but 
65.291:>>Person1>>can 
67.459:>>Person1>>like that heating unit like I'm assuming we're in like some sort of spacesuit on the moon like how does that how does heat get from the heating unit to your body 
72.984:>>Person3>>yeah 
79.015:>>Person3>>I think it's just like I think it heats up like I think we're in the wreckage of the spaceship 
83.659:>>Person1>>we're still inside the spaceship 
83.819:>>Person3>>I think we're still in the spaceship
84.609:>>Person2>>no well how I think we're trying to get there 
87.164:>>Person1>>so how do we get so like are we taking the space ship with us when we go to the rendezvous point 
87.192:>>Person3>>yeah 
93.106:>>Person3>>I think we're waiting it out and trying to communicate 
98.123:>>Person2>>because 
98.267:>>Person3>>oh okay
98.95:>>Person1>>yeah that's what I thought I thought we're getting there 
101.342:>>Person2>>how do they know where we are you know
103.174:>>Person4>>yeah I thought we were trying to get rescued no 
105.094:>>Person2>>
106.817:>>Person3>>oh okay
107.227:>>Person1>>yeah okay 
108.65:>>Person1>>I thought yeah I thought were trying to make it to them 
110.774:>>Person3>>okay we'll we'll definitely wa water is important 
111.576:>>Person1>>well that would change a lot 
115.419:>>Person3>>I agree I I agree with water
115.519:>>Person1>>yeah
117.839:>>Person1>>mhm
118.619:>>Person2>>it doesn't specify it says rank or I it items in terms of importance and allowing us to reach the point whether that be by pick up or by us getting there
125.891:>>Person2>>whether that be my pick up by us getting there 
129.146:>>Person3>>okay
129.43:>>Person1>>so the moon the moon gets really cold at night because it's like a desert because there's no water there 
129.492:>>Person2>>yes 
134.402:>>Person1>>%HESITATION there's also less much less atmosphere so that doesn't keep the heat in either but during twelve hours yeah it gets cold really fast
138.175:>>Person3>>yeah 
140.24:>>Person3>>yeah I think it I think the cold to kill us before water initially 
141.262:>>Person2>>it gets it's gonna get cold fast 
146.118:>>Person1>>water would because water's three days would you freeze at night time on the moon okay so heating then would be second 
150.304:>>Person2>>yeah 
150.334:>>Person3>>I think you'd freeze
152.733:>>Person2>>that's a question for 
155.345:>>Person1>>how would we use this heater up for debate
156.944:>>Person3>>that's 
160.508:>>Person2>>and then then water water for number three 
160.71:>>Person3>>then water 
164.531:>>Person3>>yeah 
164.693:>>Person1>>okay water for number three
168.489:>>Person2>>I was just thinking terms of 
169.944:>>Person1>>yeah 
170.898:>>Person2>>and then I had food concentrate next 
173.516:>>Person1>>well I had first aid injection needles because I you can't like 
179.668:>>Person1>>take off like your space suit to drink water like through your mouth so I was thinking like water intravenously like in the hospital when you go to surgery you can't drink water you have to have like an IV with hydration so if I don't know if like our spaceship is airtight still because otherwise you wouldn't be able to take off your gear to like drink water normally 
190.376:>>Person2>>I mean
199.222:>>Person2>>then we can't use it at all yeah 'cause then we'd still need
202.182:>>Person3>>I feel like it has to be like air tight in order to do like half of this stuff 
208.2:>>Person3>>%HESITATION
211.647:>>Person3>>right 'cause you can't really eat or drink
214.405:>>Person1>>wait you can with well you can't eat you can drink with well you can't drink but you can keep yourself hydrated intravenously 
224.29:>>Person1>>with receiving injection needles but that like 
225.45:>>Person3>>okay
229.679:>>Person1>>if if 
231.63:>>Person1>>like that would not be the next thing that was most important if we're in somewhere where we don't have to be like air tight contained'
241.629:>>Person3>>okay %HESITATION
242.862:>>Person2>>shall we specify where we are 
244.854:>>Person3>>yeah we should probably define what kind of situation we are in 
245.056:>>Person1>>yeah 
247.921:>>Person3>>so 
249.184:>>Person2>>it just says that our equipment 
253.592:>>Person3>>you want to assume that the spaceship is it's still like in tact we're just stuck there like the systems might be down but we're in like a airtight 
253.634:>>Person2>>at 
263.883:>>Person3>>vessel
263.891:>>Person1>>we're in an air tight vessel and so were also assuming that we're waiting for rescue 
268.153:>>Person3>>we're waiting for rescue
270.699:>>Person1>>okay alright
271.0:>>Person2>>so we're not going anywhere 
273.112:>>Person1>>we're just trying to survive until someone can rescue us 
276.015:>>Person2>>okay 
276.039:>>Person3>>so in that case I feel like the receiver might be 
282.856:>>Person2>>next important 
282.856:>>Person2>>and then food
282.973:>>Person3>>next important we like get communications straight away 
283.524:>>Person1>>mhm yeah 
286.976:>>Person1>>yeah
287.515:>>Person2>>so that is four and then food 
289.761:>>Person1>>yes see if you can live for up to six days without food so 
290.033:>>Person2>>
292.903:>>Person2>>I thought it was like thirty days 
294.419:>>Person1>>yeah it might be I don't know I know water's like three and then I thought food was like a week
295.664:>>Person2>>water's three 
298.808:>>Person3>>should %HESITATION
299.126:>>Person1>>but I'm sure it's longer than that it's probably just like
303.312:>>Person3>>should %HESITATION
303.497:>>Person1>>maybe you'll like pass out or something from low blood sugar 
305.098:>>Person2>>
306.975:>>Person3>>%HESITATION between food and first aid are we assuming like we may have gotten injuries in the crash 
314.475:>>Person2>>well if we got injuries that should also be like number two to take care of or three you know after like
314.591:>>Person1>>
319.002:>>Person1>>yeah 
321.87:>>Person1>>I don't know that the first aid kit is that much more useful than just like 
326.383:>>Person1>>I mean it does what what's in a first aid kit that you really like need for safety it's usually like tape and band aids and like 
334.489:>>Person3>>yeah probably very minimal
335.395:>>Person1>>I don't think it's helpful for life threatening things
339.168:>>Person3>>so probably food
340.4:>>Person2>>yeah 
340.563:>>Person1>>yeah 
341.823:>>Person3>>alright
342.6:>>Person2>>we also don't know how long we're gonna be there 
346.448:>>Person2>>it's two hundred miles and like traveling that by rover or something for them to come get us 
350.399:>>Person4>>mhm
351.842:>>Person1>>mhm yeah
352.428:>>Person2>>or like bring us more supplies and stuff
359.426:>>Person1>>so 
360.774:>>Person1>>well if they're coming to rescue us 
363.324:>>Person1>>well I don't know I had stellar map of the moon's constellations because I thought we were traveling %HESITATION I had that as number four but if we're not if we're waiting we can still have it so we could tell them all right were under at this time of day were under this constellation and that's like pretty uniform %HESITATION I don't know if the moon rotates 
368.71:>>Person2>>yeah 
371.606:>>Person3>>if we're waiting out then it's
375.224:>>Person2>>tell them where we are 
380.311:>>Person2>>yeah
387.034:>>Person1>>yeah well they have we're assuming they have the map too and they would know like you would be they would be able to match up like 
393.686:>>Person2>>at least 
393.703:>>Person3>>yeah that kind of that kind of goes with the receiver so like they know where we are we know where we are so we'll put that at six
396.569:>>Person2>>I think that's important
396.777:>>Person1>>
400.028:>>Person2>>that is six 
401.399:>>Person1>>the stellar 
403.582:>>Person1>>map six 
407.303:>>Person3>>alright %HESITATION
411.162:>>Person3>>I still feel like first I think we should put first aid pretty soon I feel like that might important to some degree
416.246:>>Person2>>you never know
418.095:>>Person1>>I mean compared to everything else left on the list I think it's probably 
423.324:>>Person1>>maybe the most important
426.267:>>Person1>>first aid kit 
428.426:>>Person1>>seven 
430.502:>>Person3>>yeah 
431.817:>>Person4>>no I forgot six
433.095:>>Person3>>%HESITATION what do we have 
436.643:>>Person1>>I don't know about the dehydrated milk like if we have food and water like do we also need the dehydrated milk
439.518:>>Person4>>
439.963:>>Person3>>I mean the more food the merrier I guess
440.284:>>Person2>>do we need that
442.574:>>Person3>>but
444.0:>>Person1>>yeah I guess
444.089:>>Person2>>
446.055:>>Person2>>yeah I had it relatively lower just because I figured food concentrate will be better 
448.38:>>Person1>>wouldn't
451.423:>>Person1>>be sufficient 
453.009:>>Person2>>at first 
455.342:>>Person2>>depends how long they take to get to us 
458.918:>>Person4>>sure
459.676:>>Person1>>signal flares and matches might be important like for them to but I is there oxygen on the moon for fire to burn 
464.85:>>Person3>>I I put those 
467.936:>>Person2>>yeah 
468.099:>>Person3>>I put those on the bottom anything that could blow up potentially 'cause we'd just be we're in an airtight container and I don't think there's any really atmosphere on the moon so like the matches the flare and the guns are put on the bottom 
472.648:>>Person1>>oh yeah because we're still in an air tight container 
483.479:>>Person1>>because there's no oxygen and they just explode 
484.021:>>Person3>>because there's no oxygen and it might it I think it would be the cause of issues 
488.847:>>Person1>>okay 
490.212:>>Person2>>yeah I had matches as like fifteen
490.252:>>Person1>>I yeah I didn't 
493.589:>>Person2>>there's no oxygen
495.251:>>Person1>>it wouldn't do anything 
496.267:>>Person2>>yeah 
497.871:>>Person1>>okay yeah I didn't know enough about the moon's atmosphere to 
501.855:>>Person1>>but okay so 
504.314:>>Person1>>that's 
507.485:>>Person2>>
508.008:>>Person1>>good to know yeah
509.605:>>Person2>>but a lot of this stuff sounds like we're supposed to be going somewhere you know 
513.072:>>Person3>>or internal repairs at least or something while we're waiting 
516.044:>>Person2>>the rope
517.682:>>Person2>>parachute 
519.89:>>Person1>>I mean we wouldn't be using any of those things as their like intended to be used on earth but maybe they could be used for repairs 
528.622:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
529.449:>>Person2>>or for carrying things 
531.057:>>Person1>>yeah carrying things yeah and the compass though that seems like most next important thing
532.336:>>Person3>>yeah 
541.795:>>Person3>>so I think we kind of agree that the rope the parachute the raft and the compass would probably be used for repairs to some degree 
552.688:>>Person2>>I don't know about the magnetism of the moon 
555.774:>>Person3>>maybe it might be yeah
555.791:>>Person1>>yeah I don't think the compass will
555.901:>>Person2>>something tells me like they don't have it like it's 
559.705:>>Person1>>yeah I think it's a difference 'cause isn't the magnetism based off of the pole that like the poles yeah so the poles of the moon are going to be different so it's going to work 
564.162:>>Person2>>because there earth yeah 
565.155:>>Person4>>yeah so the whole 
571.293:>>Person2>>it's gonna work 
571.325:>>Person1>>differently it's gonna work but it'll work very differently than it does on earth so 
575.575:>>Person2>>yeah 
576.837:>>Person2>>I don't know if we can rely on it
579.206:>>Person1>>the the other people 
580.518:>>Person2>>but if we're astronauts then we have training in using the compass
583.821:>>Person1>>well the other people would have to at least know like 
588.16:>>Person1>>which way it was
590.298:>>Person3>>I wouldn't I don't think it'd probably be used for 
593.799:>>Person3>>%HESITATION like mapping where we are I think it might be like maybe some of our equipment like it has a magnetic field to it maybe you could use that for repairs to some degree maybe 
603.066:>>Person1>>maybe 
604.957:>>Person2>>oh it's like to realign it okay 
604.968:>>Person3>>like maybe like we could figure out something's wrong if like inside the spaceship I don't 
604.995:>>Person1>>yeah 
605.0:>>Person4>>mhm
613.498:>>Person1>>I think a magnetic compass life raft and rope and parachute are pretty equal so 
613.615:>>Person2>>like sci-fi
619.099:>>Person3>>okay 
619.367:>>Person2>>yeah 
620.758:>>Person3>>I feel like nylon rope out of all those or the raft would probably be like
624.114:>>Person2>>or the parachute or the raft because you can cut it and
625.253:>>Person1>>yeah
629.101:>>Person2>>make even like a airtight seal from all that 
634.403:>>Person2>>manipulate it like a dolmer
634.506:>>Person1>>
638.169:>>Person1>>yeah okay 
639.103:>>Person3>>so %HESITATION
641.429:>>Person3>>is the parachute silk 
644.258:>>Person1>>I think rope 
646.148:>>Person1>>I don't know
647.241:>>Person1>>for like holding together what we have 
650.907:>>Person2>>okay so like rope parachute raft
652.659:>>Person1>>yeah
654.456:>>Person3>>yeah I can agree
657.721:>>Person1>>so the nine 
659.685:>>Person1>>ten
666.731:>>Person3>>so that leaves the
667.562:>>Person2>>I can't see a need for a pistol 
671.016:>>Person4>>I put that as last I feel like that was like completely
671.066:>>Person1>>yeah I put 
672.27:>>Person3>>I feel like 
675.329:>>Person4>>unnecessary
676.152:>>Person3>>I feel like it's more of a 
679.535:>>Person3>>hazard than anything like maybe if you're crazy and wanna like spring proof your own chances of survival by killing the other astronauts but 
680.909:>>Person4>>mhm
680.982:>>Person1>>yeah okay
688.12:>>Person4>>are you alone 
688.196:>>Person1>>I don't think you can do that because how are you going to make a spark 
688.196:>>Person1>>or you could in in our oxygen container 
688.49:>>Person2>>I don't think
691.808:>>Person3>>inside
693.257:>>Person2>>so no gun
695.971:>>Person3>>but you'd you'd risk killing yourself
698.53:>>Person1>>yeah it would be like firing a gun in a plane
701.457:>>Person3>>yeah %HESITATION 
702.48:>>Person2>>it'll work 
703.508:>>Person1>>but you'll kill yourself with everybody else 
706.19:>>Person3>>yeah 
706.368:>>Person2>>yeah 
708.89:>>Person3>>do you want to put the pistols last 
713.296:>>Person2>>I feel like they could have more use than the matches though 
713.313:>>Person3>>unless like 
716.547:>>Person3>>maybe we could use some of the parts from the pistols
718.908:>>Person1>>yeah 
720.739:>>Person3>>%HESITATION
721.142:>>Person2>>spring loaded 
724.273:>>Person2>>spring assistant 
727.5:>>Person3>>yeah %HESITATION
728.304:>>Person2>>or like shooting stuff it doesn't necessarily have to be like 
728.437:>>Person1>>forty five calibers yeah 
732.573:>>Person2>>a bullet but
734.477:>>Person2>>I don't know
737.04:>>Person3>>yeah 
737.04:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
740.828:>>Person3>>so we let's see what we have left we have the matches we have the pistols we have the compass and we have the flares 
748.958:>>Person1>>I think compass comes next for whatever we might use it for 
753.028:>>Person1>>because it's least hazardous of those three 
756.785:>>Person2>>I mean I imagine we're gonna need to signal something
761.041:>>Person2>>right
761.262:>>Person1>>yeah how do you signal flares once in the like %HESITATION with no air yeah without oxygen
766.133:>>Person3>>without oxygen
768.964:>>Person3>>I mean
769.058:>>Person2>>we light it inside of our unit and then bring it out it's not it's gonna die yeah
772.356:>>Person1>>it would go out 
774.129:>>Person1>>you could feed it with oxygen from an oxygen tank kind of like a Bunsen burner would that work or would the oxygen would it just suck in the flare and explode 
778.235:>>Person2>>right 
784.159:>>Person1>>like an oxygen tank
785.001:>>Person2>>sounds risky 
785.121:>>Person3>>it sounds dangerous I mean I don't know how I'd use a compass that's the big thing about it I like 
785.187:>>Person4>>
788.784:>>Person1>>also we're stranded on the moon 
789.165:>>Person2>>compass don't you just
793.269:>>Person2>>point and it goes towards north always 
795.26:>>Person3>>well for like a good a good for my survival I feel like how would I use that for my survival
801.635:>>Person2>>yeah 
801.957:>>Person1>>well there's a lot of things on here that I don't know how to use for my own survival especially on the moon but I'm assuming that I was trained as an astronaut like I don't even think you can give me two hundred pound tanks of oxygen and like survive I wouldn't know how to use it 
813.053:>>Person2>>you'd do alright
816.174:>>Person3>>so do you guys want to put the compass next just because it will least likely kill us
819.147:>>Person2>>yes 
821.593:>>Person1>>yeah
821.654:>>Person2>>yeah
826.262:>>Person1>>what is twelve 
827.562:>>Person3>>%HESITATION did you guys ever see Mars movie of the astronaut trapped on Mars yeah he's trying the Martian yeah he grows potato and you like light something to like make water
833.447:>>Person2>>Martian the Martian
840.826:>>Person2>>oh he was like making water with hydrogen 
843.63:>>Person3>>right that's the only right I like so I mean unless we're growing potatoes in a space ship I don't really know 
844.111:>>Person1>>yeah
844.377:>>Person2>>and the hydrogen like caught on fire and exploded 
848.398:>>Person1>>yeah 
855.361:>>Person2>>I think we should have the pistol next for parts 
858.757:>>Person2>>at least
860.555:>>Person3>>right that a yeah 'cause the flares and 
862.475:>>Person2>>flares and the matches are just going to cause us issues
863.418:>>Person1>>mhm yeah
869.445:>>Person2>>so now it's just a matter of which is better the flares or the matches 
873.516:>>Person1>>what's in a flare magnesium?
875.381:>>Person3>>it's magnesium I think 
878.877:>>Person4>>wouldn't they be like a different type of flare though if they're on a spaceship like maybe they're like were made for like this purpose you know 
885.84:>>Person3>>yeah 
885.997:>>Person4>>like they're not like that the same ones that are like used on earth you know 
887.653:>>Person1>>yeah 
890.032:>>Person2>>mhm
890.081:>>Person1>>maybe
891.906:>>Person3>>you 
891.944:>>Person1>>so maybe the flares
893.53:>>Person2>>before the matches
894.194:>>Person3>>we can say or at least like have the chance to signal them like you can't really do that with the matches 
895.169:>>Person1>>nah
901.0:>>Person2>>yeah
901.798:>>Person3>>okay
903.924:>>Person1>>so fourteen 
904.945:>>Person2>>fourteen fifteen
