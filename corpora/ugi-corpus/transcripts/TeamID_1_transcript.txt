5.396:>>Person2>>so should we just start by saying which are our most important items and start from there
9.396:>>Person1>>yeah I might as well as stuff that might not be important yeah and we can sort of narrow it down from both ends 
16.396:>>Person3>>so what was like everyone's number one ranking?
19.96:>>Person2>>my number one was solar power FM receiver transmitter.
24.635:>>Person1>>okay 
27.617:>>Person1>>%HESITATION mine was the oxygen 
33.635:>>Person4>>yeah I had oxygen as well
44.22:>>Person3>>mine was oxygen as well. what was your reasoning?
46.161:Person2>> so my reasoning was that we have the ship that we landed in and so presumably there's oxygen and the 
48.219:Person2>>but %HESITATION 
49.286:Person2>>how much oxygen I don't know if two one hundred pound tanks of oxygen would be enough to help four people go two hundred miles on the lunar surface 
55.88:Person2>>so I figured the 
58.18:Person2>>number one priority would be contacting the mother ship and seeing if they could help us out 
62.93:>>Person3>>okay
66.454::>>Person2>>but feel free to put in your opinions 
69.528:>>Person1>>I mean I had the FM receiver transmitter up there 
74.61:>>Person2>>yeah 
76.496:>>Person2>>and I had oxygen as number two so I think they're both up there 
82.266:>>Person1>>okay I guess we don't need to decide now but we can keep going through the top 
88.158:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
90.38:>>Person1>>so my number two was the five gallons of water 
93.455:>>Person4>>yeah yeah 
95.600:>>Person3>>okay 
96.947:>>Person4>>priorities keeping them alive and then 
98.788:>>Person4>>also getting them like to the mother ship 
105.734:>>Person3>>my second one is actually Steller map right now I dont know how much that would help them like I feel like it was important for them to know where they are 
112.734:>>Person1>>yeah that one was fairly high up on mine as well
119.14:>>Person1>>one of my questions was whether or not and I think you should be able to see the stars pretty clearly given that the moon doesn't really have the atmosphere so that originally had a question mark but then I put it at number five 
134.521:>>Person3>>so water was third for me
140.461:>>Person2>>yeah water yeah I was third for mine as well
145.586:>>Person2>>%HESITATION then my next one was signal flares again to see if we can get help from the well if we can get help from the mother ship to 
155.604:>>Person2>>get them to see where we are 
158.373:>>Person2>>assuming then can see our ship here so 
164.08:>>Person2>>I had like food in that general range

167.985:>>Person2>>yeah so my idea what the food was %HESITATION I 
173.281:>>Person2>> think humans can survive for weeks without food at all and assumably we might have food on the ship so if we end up staying in the ship then we can we'll have enough food 
186.358:>>Person2>>but I'm thinking that %HESITATION even if we take the food will run out of water long before we started out 
197.038:>>Person4>> yeah
199.134:>>Person2>>well I I don't know how long one hundred pound tanks of oxygen would last us see there I have no idea 
202.411:>>Person4>>yeah 

205.736:>>Person1>>yeah I also have no idea 
210.115:>>Person1>>how about the things that we do not need or that wouldn't be useful 
214.817:>>Person4>>the pistols 
216.88:>>Person4>>pistols %HESITATION magnetic compass 
216.88:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
216.88:>>Person1>>our 
221.467:>>Person2>>I I actually the magnetic compass is dumb because the moon doesn't have a magnetic field I didn't think about that yeah 
226.808:>>Person1>>I guess you don't have the iron core so I don't think it would work yeah 
226.954:>>Person4>>yeah yeah
227.754:>>Person3>>%HESITATION that's true I don't really think about that either 
229.754:>>Person2>>okay so no magneto's magnetic compass and going off of that I'm now not sure how useful the stellar map would be without a compass 
236.666:>>Person3>> well I thought 
243.99:>>Person4>>well I think maybe the maybe the stuff I think the solar map might be a little  
245.155:>>Person2>>yeah I think I figured if we got them together then it would help but the compass isn't going to work so I dont know
260.498:>>Person1>>I mean you 
261.55:>>Person1>>I guess the stellar map has 
262.324:>>Person1>>you know you don't necessarily need a compass to guide with the stars yeah the north star 
269.034:>>Person3>>right I guess 
270.084:>>Person2>>yeah thats true
270.459:>>Person2>>so we should get the stellar map and not the compass the compass is useless 
274.749:>>Person4>>yeah definitely not the compass
277.657:>>Person1>>yeah 

278.235:>>Person3>>I think the most useless was the box of matches because doesnt 
282.603:>>Person3>>that require like oxygen
283.982:>>Person2>>I also think having a box of matches is really useless as well really 
287.553:>>Person3>>and I don't really see like what purpose matches would bring like you're not really lighting anything and it's not going to be a good heat src either so
287.45:>>Person2>>yeah 
298.705:>>Person1>>yeah 
304.274:>>Person2>>okay so do you think we should start deciding on some definite rankings 
305.102:>>Person3>>yeah I think we should
307.862:>>Person4>>yeah like the top and bottom and then yeah 
310.4:>>Person1>>okay 
312.836:>>Person3>> so
313.344:>>Person2>>so are you guys still thinking five gallons of water for the top or 
317.695:>>Person4>>%HESITATION 
320.75:>>Person3>>or
320.401:>>Person2>>I'm just thinking that's not a lot 
322.239:>>Person4>>oxygen or water
324.239:>>Person3>>oxygen
325.23:>>Person2>>I will say oxygen too 
328.845:>>Person2>>so I think oxygen is more important than water 
331.129:>>Person4>>yeah so you can go  
333.975:>>Person4>>a couple of days a day or two without water but you can't go very long without oxygen
334.491:>>Person3>>yeah 
335.952:>>Person1>>where does the receiver go
337.726:>>Person2>>and so the other question to me as our where the solar powered FM receiver goes into that 
345.763:>>Person2>>because it seems like the task assumes we are going to be traveling the two hundred miles 
348.8:>>Person3>> yes
349.75:>>Person4>>yes
352.591:>>Person2>>but 
354.955:>>Person2>>so I I don't know if we're going to be receiving any assistance from the mother ship even if we can contact them 
358.491:>>Person4>>yeah
360.952:>>Person3>>right
362.68:>>Person1>>yeah that's that's a good question whether or not they would have the capability 
367.42:>>Person1>>or or whether it's like this stay in one place or do you have to like to think about moving some stuff yeah so maybe using like for example use the liferaft as the container for 
381.164:>>Person3>>yeah
382.447:>>Person2>>ohh I wasn't thinking about that I put the life raft like way down because I could not think of a use for it
384.392:>>Person1>>yeah I mean it it might get torn up it all depends on how durable the material is but 
391.619:>>Person1>>I wasn't sure what the life raft would have like the original purpose of the life raft 
393.619:>>Person4>> yeah
395.619:>>Person3>> yeah %LAUGHTER
396.969:>>Person1>>so I guess what what kind of life rafts are we talking
398.959:>>Person4>>for like splash down like yeah I don't know
403.532:>>Person2>>okay so  
403.987:>>Person1>>right right actually after re entry yeah yeah 
407.343:>>Person2>>what do you guys think is one the FM receiver or the food and water or well the water and oxygen 
416.306:>>Person3>>I think that the oxygen maybe should be first and then secondly the solar power receiver I think those
424.059:>>Person2>>okay and then the water I assume
426.635:>>Person3>yeah and then I think the water
433.314:>>Person2>does that sound like a reasonable plan of action   
436.662:>>Person1>>that those are my top three just slightly slightly tweaked 
441.34:>>Person1>>yes %HESITATION 
445.66:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
444.608:>>Person2>>okay so I also had signal flares up there I figured that would go with the receiver transmitter and help 
452.943:>>Person2>>getting us rescued if that's a possibility 
455.835:>>Person4>>yeah okay
456.835:>>Person1>>okay I wasn't sure if those would work out but I guess they 
456.835:>>Person1>>it's very possible I mean %HESITATION 
457.229:>>Person2>>I wasn't sure either 
464.397:>>Person1>>I guess signal flares can work some of them can work under water 
468.699:>>Person3>>oh right then you would need the box of matches for the signal flares 
471.541:>>Person1>>not necessarily unless 
471.699:>>Person3>>or it's or yeah I guess likely something occurs when under water
472.781:>Person3>> yes I guess yeah having most of them are self lighting
473.121:>>Person1>>yeah yeah 
477.836:>>Person1>>yeah yes assuming it's self lighting then I would be fine with moving that one up 
482.402:>>Person2>>okay so do you guys wanna put that before
484.288:>>Person1>>%HESITATION let's see what did I %HESITATION okay so food we discussed
488.819:>>Person3>>what about like the map would signal flares be more important than 
492.906:>>Person3>>like the map  
493.03:>>Person2>>yeah thats true
493.05:>>Person4>>I think the map might be up their little more 
493.767:>>Person2>>that's true 
494.575:>>Person2>>yeah and I'd say that yeah that's fair 
498.655:>> Person3>> so should we have the map as fourth 
499.847:>>Person1>>map is four 
499.9:>>Person1>>yeah and non signal flares for five 
501.2:>>Person4>> uhh yeah I think that's good
503.485:>>Person2>>%HESITATION alright
509.102:>> Person4>> and then maybe we can work our way down to see if we can eliminate some
509.136:>>Person2>>yeah
509.136:>>Person1>>so I would probably cut the compass well the compass and a box of matches last as well as the pistols 
519.14:>>Person4>>pistols I think would definitely would be absolutely last
522.776:>> Person3>>pistols would be absolutely last okay 
525.075:>>Person4>>because I think that's the least useful 
526.499:>>Person2>>and they probably wouldn't even work on the mood because they want oxygen'
529.819:>>Person4>>they one work effectively yeah  
529.838:>>Person1>>yeah yeah 
532.548:>>Person3>>I'm okay with putting the pistols last
538.828:>>Person1>>okay okay and then we have between the matches and the compass 
543.115:>>Person3>>maybe the 
544.353:>>Person1>> I feel like the compass with 
544.971:>>Person3>>compass 
545.083:>>Person2>>they're both just going to be dead right 
547.023:>>Person1>>yeah 
548.942:>>Person1>>okay 
546.752:>>Person3>>yes so compass maybe fourteen and then the matches are fifteen
552.383:>>Person2>>well okay so depending on how good the magnetic compass is if 
559.21:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
562.03:>>Person2>>well actually 
564.32:>>Person2>>so here's an idea 
566.447:>>Person2>>if the on 
568.796:>>Person2>>mother ship 
571.037:>>Person2>>has any sort of magnetic field producing capabilities and we have the transmitter we can tell them 
578.676:>>Person2>>turn on your jet engines to creative I like something like that I don't know
582.553:>>Person4>>that's more like we just rely on the the radio receiver for that more than the compass
590.428:>>Person2>>well I mean the radio receiver might not be useful in discerning where exactly we are relative to the yeah
597.913:>>Person4>>yeah the location 
598.073:>>Person3>>yeah that would be where like the map would come in play right that I might be
600.933:>>Person1>>I I think having that ability to communicate with the mother ship will be very useful 
605.707:>>Person2>>yeah well I I'm just thinking that if the compass doesn't point north 
610.415:>>Person2>>where does a point right like if the mother ship is producing any sort of magnetic field 
616.711:>>Person4>> mhmm mhmm
618.079:>>Person4>>but not be might not be reliably reliable strong enough to be useful right I I don't know what else also 
622.489:>>Person2>>and I I don't know enough about the umm the mother ship
622.413:>>Person1>>the moon is also 
622.413:>>Person1>>not rotating about it yeah it's rotating about our axis 
627.61:>>Person4>>yeah 
631.212:>>Person1>>right 
633.648:Person4>>but what 
632.747:>>Person1>>but what what is it north then
636.044:>>Person2>>well now it's just so I I'm thinking of the compass may point to whatever the nearest large magnetic field is 
644.205:>>Person2>>which could be the mother ship depending on 
646.108:>>Person4>>could be 
648.169:>>Person4>>but it is like a big if
649.802:>>Person1>>so I think it's like too unreliable to 
651.985:>>Person2>>all right 
653.317:>>Person2>>so we will assume the compass is deadweight 
656.2:>>Person3>>yeah
657.169:>>Person2>>so which one's lowest the box of matches or the compass
661.299:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
662.846:>>Person1>>I would say compass 
662.846:>>Person1>>yeah off the box matches 
667.181:>>Person2>>so compass is fourteen 
669.9:>>Person3>>yeah
672.127:>>Person2>>and then the box of  matches is thirteen 
662.846:>>Person3>>yep
676.278:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
677.88:>>Person3>>okay lets see 
678.597:>>Person1>>see so what are we
679.056:>>Person2>>and then I I put parachute silk for twelve 
681.984:>>Person3>>I did that as well
683.122:>>Person1>>okay mine was ten 
683.641:>>Person2>>I can't imagine a use for that 
685.566:>>Person4>>yeah mine was pretty high up there 
685.687:>>Person1>>yeah I wasn't sure unless there was like a specific solution that would involve 
692.1:>>Person3>>parachute silk %LAUGHTER
693.223:>>Person1>>parachute silk or some sort of material if your
693.79:>>Person2>> the only thing that I can think of is maybe you could use it for warmth or something 
699.893:>>Person3>> Oh yeah I was thinking how warm could 
701.339:>>Person2>>yeah and I I mean actually the moon doesn't really have an atmosphere so it wouldn't even function as a parachute 
708.351:>>Person1>>right right 
710.2:>.Person3>> it would only be like
711.136:>>Person1>>but it's like a tarp or something 
713.426:>>Person2>>well that's true yeah I think it would be better carrying thing than the life raft would be  
717.828:>>Person1>>yeah 
720.252:>>Person4>>yeah the life raft would be much bigger and harder to move
725.532:>>Person3>>or if you wanted to like maybe like keep warm you could have both the portable heater and the parachute silk like you do like a wrap around and have the portable you know underneath 
728.456:>>Person2>>thats true
738.001:>>Person2>>although it wouldn't help unless there's air inside the parachute silk
740.24:>>Person3>>that's also true
751.368:>>Person2>> uhhhh
753.393:>>Person1>>lets see
755.736:>>Person2>>and I'm thinking it would be more dead weight than anything else 
757.786:>>Person4>>the parachute?
758.2:>>Person2>>yeah and the life raft
760.393:>>Person4>>the life raft I think is a little more dead weight because it is more likely to be larger and less like more cumbersome to move 
765.0>>Person3>>yeah
769.979:>>Person2>>yeah unless it's inflatable 
772.66:>>Person4>>I mean if even if it is most likely it is inflatable and in that case it can be large enough to hold multiple people so it's gonna be cumbersome to use as something other than a life raft 
780.62:>>Person2>>yeah but it's also going to have air in it
785.432:>>Person4>>yeah but not necessarily useful air  ould be just nitrogen or something
788.957:>>Person2>>I don't know and they have in them 
800.851:>>Person3>>I have no idea
805.225:>>Person1>>yeah 
807.853:>>Person3>>if we are just talking about like it being like something that we could like used to carry things like parachute silk be more you know lighter yeah like less heavy weight than a life raft 
808.653:>>Person2>>life rafts as twelve
810.266:>>Person3>>yeah
810.4:>>Person4>>yeah
811.266:>>Person3>>%HESITATION and then parachute silk is eleven? or do we want to
812.061:Person2>> yeah and I don't know how how much we really need anything to carry stuff either the biggest things would be the hundred pound tanks of oxygen to drag us around in a parachute
820.676:>>person4>>I mean we are 
824.658:>>Person4>>roll them in the parachute 
827.19:>>Person2>>and it's on the moon so they wouldn't be that heavy
829.266:>>Person4>>yeah
830.737:>>Person2>>but I mean I I'm just thinking the the parachute would be good for helping us carry like volume 
829.266:>>Person4>>yeah
830.00:>>Person3>>yeah
838.826:>>Person2>>but there's not a lot that takes up a lot of volumes 
840.576:>>Person4>>no oh yeah
842.32:>>Person3>>yeah
843.576:>>Person1>>yeah
847.756:>>Person2>>so I think that taking the parachute silk might even just make it more difficult to carry everything 
854.082:>>Person2>>especially since you the only way I can think of carrying stuff with the parachute is are like 
put it over your shoulder right
859.891:>>Person3>>mhmm as a sack
861.629:>>Person4>>mhmm you could just drag it because like we're on the moon
862.9:>>Person2>> I mean I don't want to drag any of the stuff 
869.988:>>Person1>>so just just the thought of I I was thinking about the %HESITATION so you have the first aid kit with the injection needles and they 
877.601:>>Person1>>I don't know why it why would they mention injection needles could you poke the life raft and then get a little bit of thrust
879.2:>>Person2>>oh you could but 
879.601:>>Person1>>from the air escaping because I don't know how how significant that would be 
884.53:>>Person2>>I don't think I would be terribly significant and I've got to go to a hundred miles here
885.301:>>Person4>>potentially could but I don't know how I would go out 
891.165:>>Person4>>yes I think because the life raft is fairly large too 
895.719:>>Person4>>I'm assuming the life raft is very large
905.108:>>Person2>>yeah okay
908.108:>>Person1>>I am trying to figure out why like knowing this is a test someone came up with like why for example magnetic compass
911.035:>>Person2>>so I I'd say even if we have something that will need the parachute silk to carry it still won't be that useful 
915.0:>>Person4>>mhmm
916.9:>>Person3>>alright
923.462:>>Person3>>so so I had like parachute silk as twelve and then dehydrated milk as thirteen because I thought 
930.738:>>Person3>>dehydrated milk is less worthwhile 
932.254:>>Person2>>well I figured dehydrated milk could be like kind of food a little bit 
935.254:>>Person4>>yeah
936.1:>>Person3>> mhmm
937.287:>>Person1>>yeah yeah I I didn't have it super high I had food above the milk 
940.802:>>Person3>> yeah I had food significantly above the dehydrated milk 
942.6:>>Person4>>mhmm mhmm
946.153:>>Person2>>I know mike can give you some nutrients and its light
949:>>Person3>>okay
951.092:>>Person2>>so parachute silk eleven?
952.87:>>Person4>>I don't know about that yet maybe you should try to place some of the other stuff before 
957.052:>>Person3>>yeah do you want to try going from five down now so like
