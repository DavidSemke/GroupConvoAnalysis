0.0:>>Person1>>Okay
2.502:>>Person4>>alright %HESITATION 
3.393:>>Person1>>Do you guys want to start from the bottom or from the top?
6.38:>>Person4>>like from the bottom of the list of items you mean?
6.46:>>Person3>>I think from the top
8.889:>>Person1>>No, like, like ranking like did you want to start at fifteen or one?
10.339:>>Person4>>oh okay
10.471:>>Person3>>yeah the most important one so one
12.552:>>Person1>>Okay. So what did you guys  
13.34:>>Person2>>so did you guys take it as survival first or get to the place first?
19.331:>>Person4>>I
20.035:>>Person2>>I took it as survival first because you have to make it two hundred miles
21.189:>>Person3>>yeah I took it as survival as well
21.72:>>Person1>> I put survival
23.791:>>Person4>>yeah that's what I did I kind of tried to keep both things in mind though not just surviving 
29.718:>>Person2>>Yeah
30.298:>>Person3>>yeah
31.099:>>Person1>>So what do you guys put for number one?
33.883:>>Person2>>I put water. The five gallons of water
35.473:>>Person4>>yeah I put five gallons of water
36.531:>>Person3>>yeah I put %HESITATION the poun- I mean the oxygen tanks as
39.688:>>Person1>>I put the oxygen tanks too
41.712:>>Person2>>That was close for me, yeah.
41.773:>>Person3>>yeah
44.417:>>Person4>>I put the oxygen tanks actually down 
47.833:>>Person4>>five for me
49.701:>>Person4>>why did you guys ran the oxygen tanks so high 
52.519:>>Person1>>because you need to be able to breathe on the moon
54.395:>>Person3>>yeah because I'm not really sure if the atmosphere there would be 
57.214:>>Person4>>yeah that's true
58.514:>>Person4>>and 
58.572:>>Person3>>good for you because you could just go on for a couple of minutes if if you don't have enough oxygen so yeah
62.033:>>Person1>>yeah 
63.107:>>Person4>>I didn't I forgot about that %HESITATION good point %HESITATION 
69.703:>>Person2>>I feel like that should be our number one
72.401:>>Person1>>Okay. So does everyone agree that oxygen should be number one? Okay
72.531:>>Person4>>yeah 
74.255:>>Person3>>yeah
74.423:>>Person2>>yeah 
74.900:>>Person4>>makes sense
77.705:>>Person1>>Yeah at first I wanted to put water but then I realized you can't breathe
80.021:>>Person2>>I put I put water and food and then the oxygen tank
80.28:>>Person4>>I forgot to put
82.69:>>Person1>>So I put water for number two 
85.86:>>Person4>>yeah I would put water for number two then 
87.812:>>Person2>>yeah 
89.305:>>Person3>>I put the stellar map as the second important one
94.674:>>Person1>>Okay. Why?
95.702:>>Person3>>just because you you probably I I would've put water but then you can't go without water but then
101.32:>>Person3>>to get there you just need a basic %HESITATION idea or a guidance as to if you're even heading the right way 
101.32:>>Person3>>so I just thought the stellar map would've been a way to get there, now you have something to survive
101.32:>>Person3>>now you also need something to get there uh so the map would actually give you a better chance of getting there
101.32:>>Person3>>as you survive
125.415:>>Person1>>I guess that makes sense
126.785:>>Person4>>I I personally would put the water higher because it's a far distance and so 
131.843:>>Person1>>yeah 
132.72:>>Person4>>I think I mean two hundred miles longer than I've done I think I have ever walked so 
139.366:>>Person1>>I think the map should be high up there but I think that water is like crucial for survival too
145.114:>>Person4>>what do you think 
146.524:>>Person2>>I mean I marked water as number one I just I think like
150.749:>>Person2>>like water is 
152.401:>>Person2>>food and water because you have to survive first I guess
156.024:>>Person4>>yeah that makes sense
157.86:>>Person3>>yeah but I also %HESITATION I'm not really sure how thirsty you'd feel on the moon 
162.322:>>Person3>>I mean you're in a completely different atmosphere because %HESITATION especially when I come I mean I'm I'm from India and then they come to the US I feel super less thirsty in the US and I'm really surprised 
171.26:>>Person1>>Okay. That is interesting
172.209:>>Person2>>that's that's interesting I I didn't even think about that 
173.675:>>Person3>>it is just an observation that I made over the past one year
177.993:>>Person3>>and so I just thought it wouldn't be as important as the map but yeah still two hundred miles is a long journey and yeah you're not going to do it in a single day or just two days 
178.026:>>Person1>>Okay
188.468:>>Person4>>yeah 
189.911:>>Person2>>because you can survive what like two weeks without food and like 
195.531:>>Person2>>less than three days without water or is it I don't I don't know don't like quote me on that 
196.655:>>Person1>>Yeah I think that's
199.350:>>Person3>>okay
199.412:>>Person4>>I think you're right though
201.081:>>Person1>>Yeah. So I think so are we going with water for number two and then
204.82:>>Person3>>yeah I think we can go ahead with water yeah
213.105:>>Person4>>all right
213.782:>>Person1>>Um I put food for number three but I think the map is like 
215.877:>>Person2>>I think we can prob-
218.715:>>Person4>>yeah I would agree the map is probably
218.857:>>Person1>>a solid 
219.221:>>Person2>>or either the map or the compass 
220.816:>>Person3>>yeah map or the compass I mean there was just one below the other on my list so
222.033:>>Person4>>I've yeah I think if you have the map first it's more important than having the compass because the map gives you like more information 
228.549:>>Person2>>yeah 
230.694:>>Person2>>yeah 
231.217:>>Person1>>Okay. So we'll go with map for number three. Um
234.884:>>Person2>>because the food can be out there because you can survive longer without food than with water 
235.192:>>Person4>>yeah that's what I was thinking too
242.157:>>Person1>>%HESITATION and then for four I put the FM receiver 
247.392:>>Person1>>Um
247.454:>>Person4>>yeah I would I put it up there
247.47:>>Person2>>I actually I actually ranked that really like that are really like low on my list or high 
251.348:>>Person4>>really 
252.967:>>Person4>>why 
253.312:>>Person2>>because for me it was just like survival first so you've got to survive and then you got to think about how to get there so I ranked everything needed for survival like at the top and then after that I put everything to get to the rendezvous point
254.532:>>Person1>>Why?
267.925:>>Person4>>I think
268.877:>>Person2>>but I feel like getting there because if you if you're just surviving 
268.877:>>Person2>>there's only so much time you can have so if you make it to the point then you can get back to earth I guess in this simulation 
278.112:>>Person3>>yeah even that that was a similar thought of mine if you because most of your equipment on board was damaged 
284.999:>>Person3>>and your receiver's going to be connected with your equipment onboard and %HESITATION 
291.118:>>Person3>>you if you even if you have the receiver you you can't really guide us nobody's going to say okay come ten miles and then take a left
297.004:>>Person1>>okay that's a good point 
297.781:>>Person3>>it just made more sense to me that way
301.056:>>Person4>>uh
301.094:>>Person3>>%HESITATION that you'd have to get that on your own 
304.308:>>Person3>>and so I ranked that really low
304.518:>>Person2>>I still think that would probably import it would be important to have at some point
304.786:>>Person1>>Yeah
308.948:>>Person4>>my reasoning was that I feel like 
313.057:>>Person4>>we're ranking it to bring with us it probably works fine and so yeah and it's small so I mean it's not something that I feel it would be a big problem like two hundred pound tank of oxygen I mean yeah so I think having it is important because even if nothing's happening at some point during your journey it could work like transmitting to the people at the other base and they can tell you oh you're going the wrong way 
316.745:>>Person2>>cause it's small
324.86:>>Person1>>Yeah
334.646:>>Person1>>Or it can provide a location so they could like maybe come closer to you 
339.755:>>Person4>>yeah 
342.162:>>Person3>>okay
343.096:>>Person2>>I think we should rank that one next 
345.438:>>Person2>>based on what you guys are saying
347.951:>>Person1>>Okay. So does everyone feel good about putting that as number four?
348.157:>>Person4>>I think it's pretty important yeah 
350.732:>>Person2>>Yeah
351.455:>>Person4>>what do you think?
353.857:>>Person3>>yeah
355.057:>>Person1>>I can't think of a better one 
356.923:>>Person3>>yeah I I had the compass in mind but yeah if you have the map then it pretty much solves the purpose of direction
364.351:>>Person3>>and then %HESITATION the FM receiver just gives you external help or 
369.044:>>Person3>>just support rather than you being all alone
372.591:>>Person3>>could make sense though it was really low on my list but yeah
377.691:>>Person1>>So we good for that one?
378.152:>>Person2>>yeah yeah 
388.63:>>Person1>>Wow I spelled that wrong.
394.291:>>Person1>>Um I had the heating unit for number five 
394.443:>>Person2>>'cause the moon is cold
398.896:>>Person1>>Yeah
399.167:>>Person2>>I don't know where we are at the moon
401.518:>>Person3>>it just says the 
403.358:>>Person3>>but then 
406.474:>>Person4>>I put the first aid kit before the heating unit 
410.625:>>Person4>>because I don't know what might happen because it's long journey something could happen I don't know 
416.561:>>Person2>>I mean I would put them next next to each other but I would put the heating unit first and then the first aid kit
421.182:>>Person2>>I don't know 
421.788:>>Person1>>I agree with that too because you can like guarantee that you're going to be cold but you don't like have a guarantee that you're going to get hurt 
426.228:>>Person4>>yeah that's true actually that makes sense
428.801:>>Person3>>would you rather put okay we have water oh okay
431.812:>>Person3>>yeah makes sense
431.915:>>Person1>>okay yeah we don't have food on their either so we definitely should consider that 
432.035:>>Person4>>yeah honestly
437.869:>>Person1>>Um
439.533:>>Person4>>I I would put the heating unit and then the food I think
440.036:>>Person3>>yeah 
442.553:>>Person1>>Okay so we want to go heating unit for number five?
444.122:>>Person3>>yeah I think heating unit
444.85:>>Person2>>yeah 
448.259:>>Person2>>and then the food that's probably a good one 
451.061:>>Person1>>to follow up with the heating unit? 
451.787:>>Person2>>yeah cause we already have the water and the food concentrate so you just add the water to the food concentrate
456.776:>>Person3>>yeah
457.322:>>Person1>>and then okay so food after heating unit I like that 
465.486:>>Person2>>and then the first aid kit
466.952:>>Person1>>yeah the first aid kit can go after food if you think that that's important 
469.977:>>Person3>>I I would think the life raft uh
473.811:>>Person4>>I put the
474.06:>>Person3>>instead of the first aid kit 
475.234:>>Person4>>really
475.929:>>Person4>>what would you use the life raft for?
477.566:>>Person2>>yeah that's what I was wondering 'cause there's no 'cause there's no 'cause there's no water on the moon 
477.962:>>Person1>>yeah I ranked it super low on my list 
479.312:>>Person4>>I ranked it like almost the bottom there's no water on the moon
481.686:>>Person3>>I know but
482.912:>>Person2>>you can dump out your five gallons of water 
483.913:>>Person3>>yeah 
483.934:>>Person1>>make a river
487.628:>>Person4>>yeah I don't I don't know what I would use a life raft for 
487.931:>>Person2>>I was wondering why there was a life raft
487.942:>>Person3>>yeah makes sense
491.928:>>Person1>>yeah I put the life raft like on the bottom
493.162:>>Person3>>okay yeah never mind doesn't make sense yeah
496.76:>>Person2>>I was also wondering what the pistols were for I ranked-
498.818:>>Person1>>I put that at the bottom too 
499.464:>>Person3>>yeah I put that on the last spot 
500.369:>>Person4>>yeah I put that at the bottom
502.683:>>Person4>>um
502.746:>>Person1>>%HESITATION so what are we considering for after food? we're considering the first aid kit 
509.029:>>Person2>>I think so
512.392:>>Person4>>yeah I should think so
512.952:>>Person1>>I think if we put the first aid kit we've covered like oxygen, water, food, heat, injury, and like contacting people 
519.574:>>Person3>>but what about the rope?
522.56:>>Person2>>and the rope I ranks super high because like 
525.271:>>Person3>>yeah that that would be helpful
526.091:>>Person2>>because like my dad's a scout leader and you can do so much with the rope 
529.532:>>Person3>>I mean it could just help you with the terrain and also help you with the terrain if you need to get up somewhere and it's
531.25:>>Person2>>'cause you can tie all your you can tie all your stuff together 
537.405:>>Person1>>okay which one the parachute silk or the safety the nylon rope okay 
539.121:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the nylon tope
539.143:>>Person2>>the rope the rope
542.085:>>Person4>>so what are we saying for that that goes after food?
542.603:>>Person3>>either that or 
542.717:>>Person1>>I think so 
544.443:>>Person2>>and then probably the first aid kit after that 
547.584:>>Person3>>yeah 
547.863:>>Person1>>that's true because you can also bandage like injuries with rope 
549.729:>>Person2>>yeah with rope 
550.830:>>Person4>>yeah that makes sense
552.202:>>Person1>>so yeah the nylon rope 
552.537:>>Person4>>yeah I'd all right
552.773:>>Person2>>rope is so versatile. So that's seven and then 
557.12:>>Person4>>so rope and then the first aid kit 
557.719:>>Person1>>I think so yeah 
560.545:>>Person3>>yeah
567.075:>>Person4>>rope 
568.245:>>Person2>>and then I think next we should probably look at the matches or the compass
573.293:>>Person3>>I would say the signal flares
575.073:>>Person2>>yeah yeah 
575.359:>>Person4>>yeah I I would 
576.074:>>Person1>>yeah you don't need matches to light a flare, right? you just like 
578.748:>>Person4>>I don't think matches would even work in space so
578.866:>>Person3>>yeah it is 
581.499:>>Person2>>yeah that's actually a really good point 
581.692:>>Person1>>That's a good point. Would flares work in space?
583.996:>>Person4>>I think flares would work because they provide their own like heat like fuel src
587.885:>>Person1>>They have - okay yeah I like the flares then, we'll go the flares 
590.326:>>Person2>>yeah we should probably put matches last I didn't even think about 
592.918:>>Person1>>yeah I didn't - that didn't occur to me either 
595.568:>>Person4>>so after first aid kit, flares? Is that guys are
596.111:>>Person2>>so yeah 
596.244:>>Person1>>I think so 
596.28:>>Person3>>yeah
600.546:>>Person1>>yeah I forgot it was space.
603.851:>>Person4>>I can't believe I forgot about oxygen but
607.779:>>Person1>>I mean that's why I put oxygen first, I know you can't breathe in space but I forgot that matches need oxygen 
613.893:>>Person3>>maybe the compass next
615.071:>>Person2>>yeah yeah
615.208:>>Person4>>yeah I would put the compass next
615.339:>>Person1>>yeah. I think the compass should go next too 
617.407:>>Person2>>that's number ten right?
618.591:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I believe so 
619.671:>>Person3>>yeah ten
620.19:>>Person2>>okay cool. I can count.
621.829:>>Person1>>%HESITATION and then I think that the life raft should go last because I can't 
628.338:>>Person3>>yeah 
628.644:>>Person2>>well I mean what you can also do is you can put all the stuff in the life raft to carry yeah and you got the rope and you could carry it 
632.357:>>Person1>>oh and pull it. You have the rope
632.759:>>Person3>>and then we'll let 
635.846:>>Person1>>and if someone's injured you could put them in the life raft and pull them because you have a crew it's not just you 
638.199:>>Person4>>it is easier to pull things on the moon so yeah 
644.03:>>Person1>>I didn't know about the pistols like I just couldn't
644.03:>>Person2>>what what what are you going to shoot like 
644.600:>>Person1>>your crewmembers? to eat them if you got hungry?
645.982:>>Person4>>yeah I would yeah 
652.036:>>Person4>>yeah I don't know what I would use the guns for
654.522:>>Person2>>but I think the life raft would probably be nice because you have five gallons of water and two hundred pound tanks of oxygen that 
656.209:>>Person4>>life rafts would probably be more useful than the gun
661.139:>>Person4>>yeah 
661.643:>>Person2>>you have to somehow get to the rendezvous point
664.284:>>Person1>>okay so do we want to put the life raft after the compass?
669.461:>>Person1>>because even though it's not like 
671.235:>>Person1>>I feel like it's more useful than everything else that we have left 
671.597:>>Person2>>super  
674.249:>>Person2>>yeah 
675.511:>>Person2>>because everything else we have 
675.596:>>Person3>>unless unless you need milk but yeah you have enough okay yeah even me
677.906:>>Person1>>I put milk last
677.915:>>Person4>>yeah I didn't need milk yeah 
680.335:>>Person2>>the milk the pistols 
682.713:>>Person2>>yeah nothing else is really like helpful
685.289:>>Person1>>Yeah
686.316:>>Person2>>I think the life raft is probably the most important thing that we have left
689.225:>>Person3>>what what could you use the parachute silk for? 
691.928:>>Person1>>Um it's the cord, right? Is that what they're talking about? Like the cord that holds parachutes together?
695.997:>>Person2>>or is it I I took it as the parachute 
699.813:>>Person1>>I guess you can use it to like 
699.813:>>Person1>>like shelter like if you wanted to like build a shelter you can
701.307:>>Person2>>to like fly
703.034:>>Person4>>yeah like a tent
703.171:>>Person2>>yeah because that's a probably more important than the life raft
707.695:>>Person1>>so we could put the parachute and then the life raft 
709.649:>>Person2>>yeah 
710.782:>>Person4>>makes sense
711.334:>>Person3>>okay
711.642:>>Person2>>do you guys agree with that?
714.023:>>Person3>>yeah
714.751:>>Person1>>Or do you see a better option?
717.916:>>Person4>>no I think that makes sense to me 
720.640:>>Person3>>yeah 
721.382:>>Person4>>that is what I kind of did in my thing anyway
723.769:>>Person1>>that's how I did mine too so then the pressure and then the life raft 
724.786:>>Person4>>yeah 
728.281:>>Person2>>now we're getting to the stuff 
729.659:>>Person2>>like 
729.766:>>Person1>>yes so now we have the matches the pistols and the milk 
732.685:>>Person3>>I'd say the milk 
734.796:>>Person4>>parachute and the
735.469:>>Person3>>the pistols and then the matches 
737.153:>>Person1>>you think the matches should go last? 
739.465:>>Person3>>I don't really see what I I'd use the matches for
743.598:>>Person1>>that's a good point 
743.608:>>Person3>>or even if they would work
745.634:>>Person2>>yeah 
746.561:>>Person1>>that's a good point so I guess matches can go last because we don't know if they would work 
749.173:>>Person2>>the milk would probably be also useful. I mean because it's milk, you can drink it  
752.752:>>Person1>>yeah 
755.166:>>Person1>>so wait
756.315:>>Person1>>do we want to do milk after the life raft
758.405:>>Person4>>yeah I would I would bring the milk first before the other two things
758.748:>>Person3>>yeah
760.461:>>Person2>>yeah because the other two are useless
760.822:>>Person1>>okay 
762.361:>>Person1>>okay so we'll do milk
762.442:>>Person4>>yeah 
765.851:>>Person2>>I honestly think the matches would be more useful than the pistol
767.769:>>Person1>>than the pistol, me too
769.717:>>Person1>>yeah
770.205:>>Person4>>wait so what what did you say 
771.743:>>Person1>>I- we think the matches will be more useful than the pistols
772.225:>>Person2>>so we put
773.669:>>Person2>>so we have the matches and the pistol left, 
775.759:>>Person2>>and I think
775.837:>>Person3>>but the thing was the matches would probably not even work but the pistol could work
778.176:>>Person2>>yeah
778.726:>>Person2>>but
779.556:>>Person2>>but what would you use it for?
782.105:>>Person4>>we jumped it in the air shouldn't it so it you can go one way 
783.098:>>Person3>>maybe getting a break shooting stuff off and going ahead
786.835:>>Person1>>wait but like wouldn't the pistol not like how how would that work 
791.026:>>Person4>>no it'll work because the gun fired gunpowder doesn't need oxygen 
791.233:>>Person3>>yeah 
794.387:>>Person1>>yeah but matches do, yeah. So we'll do
