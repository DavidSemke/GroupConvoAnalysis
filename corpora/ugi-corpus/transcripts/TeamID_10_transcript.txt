2.167:>>Person3>>okay so 
3.167:>>Person1>>what is the top three in your list
5.8:>>Person4>> top three
9.058:>>Person2>>I think the first and most important for me is two hundred pound tanks of oxygen you're on the moon and you just can't do without oxygen 
16.585:>>Person1>>you just say the first three we will see after that
19.507:>>Person2>>second is the stellar map of the moons constellations this is my second %HESITATION on the list and third is the signal flare 
25.00:>> Person1>> Okay
27.477:>>Person4>>so mine is magnetic compass fifty feet nylon rope and 
33.57:>>Person4>>hundred pounds of oxygen 
35:8:>>Person1>> Okay, yours?
36.093:>>Person3>>so 
36.093:>>Person3>>so I think the most important is the the solar powered FM transmitter and receiver so that you can communicate 
36.093:>>Person3>>the second one is the stellar map
45.708:>>Person3>>and the the third one is two hundred pounds of oxygen 
52.057:>>Person4>>I think like all of us agree on 
53.6:>>Person1>>oxygen
54.442:>>Person2>>see I think oxygen is a primary requirement and all of us agree that it should be on the top 
62.67:>>Person1>>yeah yeah mine as well 
64.703:>>Person1>>one was oxygen then I had water and compass
70.232:>>Person2>>point is for compass I have a point 
70:89:>>Person1>> Yeah I was not sure
70.9:>>Person2>>so magnetic compass is calibrated according to earth's magnetic field I don't know how much useful it will be on the moon 
70.9:>>Person1>> that I was not sure
71.618:>>Person3>>so on moon 
72.285:>>Person1>>yeah I should 
72.933:>>Person3>>there is no magnetic field
76.921:>>Person1>>yeah that I was not sure 
79.092:>>Person3>>no on moon there is no magnetic north and magnetic south 
80.913:>>Person2>>there is no magnetic field yes so it will be basically useless 
80.968:>>Person1>>yeah 
81.187:>>Person4>>it 
82.94:>>Person1>>so maybe the stellar map then
85.205:>>Person3>>yes 
85.499:>>Person2>>stellar map is more important to 
86.581:>>Person3>>and I think the FM receiver should be important if you want to communicate 
89.264:>>Person4>>be an important does 
91.529:>>Person1>>so one should be oxygen right because you need to live 
91.686:>>Person2>>yeah right right
91.689:>>Person4>>yeah 
93.77:>>Person3>>it 
95.36:>>Person4>>yeah 
95.493:>>Person2>>right 
96.667:>>Person4>>so let's just put oxygen on one 
100.316:>>Person4>>then the stellar map we can put down as two if everyone agrees
102.17:>>Person2>>yeah we should put on two
102.243:>>Person3>>yeah 
103.682:>>Person1>>and then if the FM transmitter
105.001:>>Person2>>FM we should put on three yeah 
105.001:>>Person1>>okay
111.506:>>Person3>>okay how about the next three 
112.181:>>Person1>>let 
113.325:>>Person2>>next three 
115.33:>>Person1>>so just 
116.233:>>Person3>>so I have a point aboard the flares flares need oxygen to burn 
120.849:>>Person2>>that is true that is true 
121.029:>>Person3>>so 
122.516:>>Person3>>if there is no atmosphere there is no
124.994:>>Person4>>no but then the signal flares will
125.092:>>Person2>>
127.774:>>Person3>>I mean they burn right so they need oxygen
131.652:>>Person3>>without the oxygen there is no point to this with 
133.896:>>Person2>>see I think I think the next important part is  you're making a safari sort of thing right so basically you really need some water that will keep you going so water is probably the four 
138.196:>>Person3>>yes 
140.516:>>Person3>>yes what is the next one yes water
141.444:>>Person4>>yeah 
141.551:>>Person1>> yeah
143.368:>>Person4>>water and milk 
144.037:>>Person1>>should we 
145.752:>>Person1>> milk 
146.371:>>Person2>>milk is a comfort at that point of time yeah 
146.467:>>Person3>>I think first aid kit
146.616:>>Person4>>okay for milk we can put that later 
149.852:>>Person1>>water water 
151.575:>>Person3>>like survival so if anything goes wrong you need 
155.473:>>Person2>>but then you are on a moon you are wearing space suits so will that be very essential 
157.943:>>Person4>>yeah 
160.565:>>Person1>>How about
160.667:>>Person3>>what if there is a crash like there has been already a crash like if somebody is injured 
163.833:>>Person2>>that is it yeah 
166.089:>>Person1>>let's see if we can find anything 
167.343:>>Person3>>yes 
168.077:>>Person4>>what about nylon rope to pull you towards the 
170.16:>>Person2>>I think nylon rope yeah those are more important 
170.938:>>Person1>>sure yeah 
174.339:>>Person4>>because there is no atmosphere there are chances that you might not know not what gravity is what 
175.368:>>Person2>>the 
177.975:>>Person2>>another thing is also on moon there is no heating 
178.144:>>Person3>>life raft 
178.413:>>Person1>>what a life raft
182.478:>>Person2>>so maybe portable heating unit can also be another potential 
182.495:>>Person4>>yeah 
185.584:>>Person4>>so should we go with heating unit that 
186.501:>>Person3>>portable heating unit is actually fourth on my list
190.231:>>Person1>>okay what are your four five and six then
190.253:>>Person4>> umm 
191.712:>>Person4>>%HESITATION so more of four was  then life raft 
191.712:>>Person4>>and then five was FM transmitter for
200.424:>>Person4>>communication and six was a box of matches but then considering that you like you do not have oxygen that say about you 
206.96:>>Person2>>there's no atmosphere my four five six are 
206.96:>>Person2>>five gallons of water solar powered FM transmitter receiver which you already put in six is portable heating unit so 
207.563:>>Person1>>like it 
216.971:>>Person1>>mine was first aid kit map and  
216.971:>>Person1>>food concentrate
222.23:>>Person3>>mine is a portable heating unit 
222.23:>>Person3>>first aid kit
222.23:>>Person3>>and Food concentrate 
228.466:>>Person2>>I think we all agree that the portable heating unit and water is more important so we can 
229.793:>>Person1>>what 
233.743:>>Person1>>that's what what does 
233.905:>>Person4>>what about the nylon rope to let them tether you 
234.082:>>Person3>>so 
237.356:>>Person1>>you have to survive first
239.204:>>Person4>>okay 
239.223:>>Person2>>so maybe water is four and heating unit is five
239.725:>>Person1>>then your water is four 
239.987:>>Person3>>yeah heating five 
242.791:>>Person1>>and then six is first aid 
246.089:>>Person4>>no I think I will put first aid later because 
246.395:>>Person2>> Had this been earth I would have put first aid 
250.316:>>Person2>>on the top of the list but this is the moon so 
250.866:>>Person1>> water is four and 
253.616:>>Person4>>yeah 
253.684:>>Person1>> heating unit is five
261.351:>>Person1>>how how heavy is the portable heating unit I am not very
266.659:>>Person4>>but then 
266.659:>>Person4>>the gravity is low right so you're not going to feel that weight 
267.552:>>Person2>>it's portable with the word portable gives you 
274.904:>>Person1>>five was portable heating unit six is 
278.439:>>Person1>>so we still have 
280.045:>>Person4>>should we put nylon rope
281.005:>>Person3>>should we put food first
283.491:>>Person2>>I think we should put that nylon rope as six 
288.146:>>Person2>>or the first aid kit at six probably 
291.4:>>Person1>>what are your next three
293.386:>>Person4>>no let's start with you and see 
293.633:>>Person3>>so nylon rope wait nylon rope %HESITATION 
298.177:>>Person2>>I mean if you're moving in groups and if there is lunar storm or something like that and then you can just tether yourself together 
300.49:>>Person1>>yeah
303.314:>>Person4>>and they 
303.557:>>Person2>>and move in a group
306.593:>>Person1>>or you are going like 
308.02:>>Person1>>they're going they can 
312.543:>>Person3>>okay we can put the nylon rope
313.949:>>Person2>>yeah if there's a difficult terrain it can help you maybe get so 
317.928:>>Person1>>the rest as you all can stay together if you're like holding on to the rope
320.994:>>Person2>>exactly yes so basically nylon rope should be six 
320.994:>>Person2>>possibly
325.582:>>Person4>>maybe seven we can agree on first aid kit
328.558:>>Person1>>what
328.558:>>Person1>>first aid kit or 
329.074:>>Person3>>or food 
329.446:>>Person2>>we'll take three at a time 
331.219:>>Person4>>okay 
334.706:>>Person2>>so fifty feet of nylon rope is six 
335.012:>>Person1>>what are your seven eight and nine
335.900:>>Person2>>seven was the nylon rope eight was the parachute silk and nine was one case of dehydrated milk
336.714:>>Person4>> can someone clarify what is parachute silk
351.324:>>Person2>>I'm assuming that this is the silk that these they use to make the parachute from but in events like this it can be used as since it is parachute quality silk so it can be used for several other applications also in the event of some emergencies and all that so
351.324:>>Person2>>like you can we cut and then used to use for different things
351.368:>>Person1>>
351.528:>>Person3>>this is the 
359.193:>>Person4>> like a tent 
370.797:>>Person2>>something of that sort I mean like you can do some utility stuff with it so 
376.235:>>Person1>>What are your
377.174:>>Person2>>my seven eight nine eight two 
378.349:>>Person3>>so my seven is the the dehydrated milk eight is fifty feet of nylon rope 
385.311:>>Person3>>and nine is the nine was the water but we already put that 
390.226:>>Person4>>so my seven was water but we already put that eight was portable heating element unit because already there and the nine was parachute silk
398.917:>>Person1>> mine was FM receivers
400.134:>>Person1>>signal flares and life raft 
407.515:>>Person1>>well we don't right
408.622:>>Person3>>maybe we can put the food now maybe because effect 
410.728:>>Person4>>maybe we can put the life raft also
413.266:>>Person3>>life raft is something you need if there is water
414.271:>>Person2>>life raft is also legit if there's water there's no water on moon at least not proven so 
416.5:>>Person1>>yeah 
416.54:>>Person4>>yeah 
419.031:>>Person3>>we're going to 
420.473:>>Person1>>so I think food 
421.894:>>Person3>>yeah I think that's the next thing to survive 
422.346:>>Person4>>what about 
424.383:>>Person4>>but a short distance yeah 
424.386:>>Person2>>food and parachute silk I should say they think it's like let's put a little bit of food and little bit of utility stuff together yeah 
429.552:>>Person1>>seven and eight and 
431.503:>>Person1>>seven is food 
431.568:>>Person4>>what about the first aid kit we left out the first aid kit completing the 
431.689:>>Person3>>
434.227:>>Person1>> ohh
436.047:>>Person2>>who 
436.827:>>Person1>>so 
436.929:>>Person3>>so food then first aid and then silk
437.275:>>Person2>> food then first aid kit and then silk
441.309:>>Person4>>so food concentrate 
442.66:>>Person3>>yeah 
444.406:>>Person1>>food concentrate
445.556:>>Person4>>because like water is already there
449.73:>>Person4>>so food concentrate is seven 
451.239:>>Person1>>eight is first aid kit
452.985:>>Person4>>nine is uhh
456.46:>>Person4>>parachute silk
459.598:>>Person2>>now we are coming to slowly coming to useless things
463.568:>>Person3>>so my my ten was parachute silk and we already used that  so eleven is pistols and twelve is box of matches 
477.502:>>Person2>>books of matches is just useless
479.821:>>Person3>>yeah that is not good 
480.445:>>Person2>>and it can potentially be dangerous as I mean if you're getting an oxygen cylinder and then matches and everything so that's why my box of matches is just last on the list so 
486.101:>>Person1>>my my
488.856:>>Person1>>ten eleven twelve was nylon rope parachute silk and pistols
493.718:>>Person2>>okay my my ten eleven twelve was magnetic compass liferaft and food concentrate 
499.681:>>Person1>>so we can put
500.82:>>Person2>>I think we can
501.335:>>Person4>>my ten was first aid kit my eleven was milk and my twelve was food concentrate so like all of them have been covered 
509.573:>>Person3>>I think milk we should put like the next
512.774:>>Person4>>what about the pistol
512.953:>>Person2>>see what other things remaining liferaft magnetic compass 
517.099:>>Person3>>signal flares 
517.099:>>Person3>>pistols box of matches 
517.232:>>Person1>>signal flares 
517.609:>>Person2>>signal flares pistols and box of matches out of these 
517.609:>>Person2>>I'm assuming that there is no like life risk on moon from humans so from creatures to pistols are
522.423:>>Person1>>pistols can be used to break open something 
525.997:>>Person3>>we've gone from 
531.544:>>Person1>>break open a box or  
532.324:>>Person2>>yeah
534.624:>>Person3>>like Newton's third law 
534.943:>>Person1>>opens a a box not to kill each other what 
535.071:>>Person2>>yeah then the I mean pistols can be a utility stuff in that case 
535.071:>>Person2>>we went to 
536.172:>>Person4>>yeah exactly 
545.461:>>Person4>>we can move it at ten pistols
547.443:>>Person1>>if we agree 
547.739:>>Person3>>no no no we have milk milk is the most important thing among 
547.739:>>Person3>>these 
552.715:>>Person4>>life raft is maybe just for maybe dumping stuff 
555.73:>>Person2>>life raft again it can be used as like to carry the material or the material can be used for 
555.73:>>Person2>>stuff 
555.73:>>Person2>>and those are 
556.26:>>Person3>>and 
561.173:>>Person1>>okay to carry our tanks and everything we can just pull the life raft
562.73:>>Person2>>yeah and then you need the rope which we already covered 
571.862:>>Person4>>we agreed that the magnetic compass and box of matches that they going to be the last two
572.097:>>Person2>>signals flares are also 
578.062:>>Person4>>okay so now would that we have last three sorted why dont we write that down first
582.907:>>Person3>>no then is the milk 
583.453:>>Person2>>lets write ten milk
586.138:>>Person1>>milk and pistols right
588.084:>>Person2>>milk and pistols yeah 
589.126:>>Person4>>yeah 
589.176:>>Person1>>ten and eleven
596.64:>>Person4>>then the pistols
599.248:>>Person1>>we have a life raft 
600.653:>>Person4>>life raft is twelve
600.808:>>Person2>>then the life raft is twelve 
600.808:>>Person2>>and then we can use any order I mean 
603.47:>>Person4>>with the compasses 
604.223:>>Person3>>matches is probably thirteen 
606.622:>>Person2>>so really the matches I think should be last because you're getting oxygen cylinders 
607.279:>>Person4>>fifteen 
612.289:>>Person2>>you try to avoid the fire risk as much as possible I mean matches it's an inflammable item right so signal flares matches these are inflammable stuff so yeah 
613.197:>>Person3>>why is that 
613.398:>>Person1>>if I 
618.436:>>Person4>>I have 
620.217:>>Person4>>I have a question about signal flares like you mean  those signals which are in the atmosphere or  
627.392:>>Person2>>no no no these are these are small bullet shots and you shoot them to go up in the air and often 
627.65:>>Person1>>yeah yeah yeah sort of and then it should light up 
633.663:>>Person1>>sure 
633.663:>>Person1>>I don't know if it's going 
633.679:>>Person4>>but then I suppose this 
636.957:>>Person4>>thing is also a hazard because the flame so put it on fourteen 
637.287:>>Person1>> wait wait wait wait
642.878:>>Person3>>so thirteen will be compass
642.878:>>Person3>>less risky 
644.592:>>Person4>>compass 
644.7:>>Person2>>lets put thirteen as compass
644.7:>>Person2>>it's less risky and %HESITATION flare is actually more protected than matches so that's fourteen and matches fifteen 
653.971:>>Person3>>okay 
656.794:>>Person1>>we came to a concensus
658.657:>>Person2>>good 
658.817:>>Person4>> yeah
661.471:>>Person2>>We have nothing more to discuss 
663.99:>>Person4>>yeah we are done 
663.994:>>Person3>>yeah are we discussing politics now
