2.06:>>Person5>>I wanted the clap anyway
2.205:>>Person1>>alright 
2.277:>>Person2>>alright %HESITATION okay so 
3.089:>>Person4>>hahaha
4.979:>>Person4>>
4.988:>>Person1>>okay so 
5.132:>>Person5>>
9.331:>>Person4>>do you wanna just like go down starting with the box of matches?
12.709:>>Person1>>okay we can then then say what our ranking is and debate from there okay so %HESITATION for a box of matches I put that as twelve 
12.816:>>Person4>>or 
22.5:>>Person2>>I put it as thirteen
24.819:>>Person3>>fifteen
25.195:>>Person5>>fifteen
25.718:>>Person4>>fifteen
26.765:>>Person2>>okay so that's pretty close do we want to just go through all of them and see where we like differ the most 
29.904:>>Person5>>yeah
30.278:>>Person3>>yeah 
31.656:>>Person1>>okay food concentrate I put that at four 
34.499:>>Person2>>four

48.391:>>Person5>>nine
48.857:>>Person5>>I'm not entirely clear on exactly what it is though
50.911:>>Person2>>what it would be used for yeah that's kind of 
52.723:>>Person4>>I was thinking blankets
52.907:>>Person5>>well no just what it is, is it, is it
53.627:>>Person3>>I have ideas we can talk about that later 
54.476:>>Person1>>it's multi purpose 
55.315:>>Person2>>okay Carson is survival guy so 
57.963:>>Person1>>and then %HESITATION portable heating unit three

83.205:>>Person2>>let's put that one
83.223:>>Person1>>alright 
83.526:>>Person3>>alright 
86.422:>>Person1>>alright and then stellar %cough stellar map six

128.527:>>Person5>>six
129.184:>>Person2>>okay
129.66:>>Person3>>%HESITATION what was yours sorry for the last 
130.158:>>Person1>>oh I I had seven
130.201:>>Person5>>
133.269:>>Person3>>and you?
134.068:>>Person5>>%HESITATION six 
135.013:>>Person4>>oh that was me 
135.051:>>Person3>>okay
136.498:>>Person5>>yeah so 
136.535:>>Person3>>so yeah I kept a tally of all the numbers would you like me to 
136.655:>>Person1>>ah I should've
137.091:>>Person2>>he did it it's okay
137.496:>>Person4>>yeah 
139.431:>>Person1>>
142.05:>>Person3>>run through them 
143.568:>>Person2>>I mean we all just said them I don't think that's
143.664:>>Person4>>yeah glasses are 
143.865:>>Person5>>%HESITATION that's fine
144.132:>>Person1>>I was gonna actually do you wanna just go ahead and start with some like discrepancies you see like some major changes preferences
147.815:>>Person3>>okay 
148.485:>>Person2>>yeah 'cause I think some of it might be like confusion like some of these things I was like why would I need that so I ranked it very %HESITATION low
150.053:>>Person3>>mhm
152.596:>>Person5>>yeah 
153.245:>>Person3>>so 
154.269:>>Person1>>right 
154.336:>>Person5>>
154.606:>>Person4>>yeah 
156.205:>>Person3>>there's a large disparity in the compass from four to fourteen %HESITATION moon doesn't have a magnetic field 
159.492:>>Person5>>doesn't have 
159.783:>>Person1>>yeah that's so I 
161.579:>>Person2>>okay %HESITATION s
161.785:>>Person4>>I'm just dumb okay 
165.279:>>Person3>>so that makes that 
165.839:>>Person5>>
167.481:>>Person4>>I wasn't sure the life raft was but there's no water on the moon so I don't think we need it
167.718:>>Person2>>yeah I wasn't sure about that either
167.915:>>Person3>>yeah it could be
170.153:>>Person1>>yeah I was also 
170.248:>>Person3>>the life raft could be insulative if you use your heater and a raft as a shelter 
176.8:>>Person5>>yeah
176.904:>>Person2>>okay 
177.042:>>Person4>>oh you know what that's really smart
178.294:>>Person5>>that and also getting down slopes
180.835:>>Person2>>okay 
181.311:>>Person5>>you don't know what the geography is like
181.496:>>Person1>>that's true 
183.837:>>Person2>>so so for that come for the compass is there literally you cannot use it on the moon at all?
186.184:>>Person4>>I'm okay with it higher 
188.53:>>Person1>>there's 
188.718:>>Person5>>no
189.558:>>Person3>>there is definitely magnetic rock on the moon but it doesn't provide poles of magnetic attraction so it would kind of be a fun little art piece
192.827:>>Person1>>but like 
194.496:>>Person1>>yeah 
194.673:>>Person5>>you can't use it to you can't
195.586:>>Person4>>oh so you can't like use the magnet to like find like the one 
200.301:>>Person2>>so fifteen 
200.632:>>Person1>>h
200.639:>>Person5>>no
203.186:>>Person3>>%HESITATION
203.22:>>Person2>>do people want to put that as the last one 
204.533:>>Person1>>I don't know if this is like getting too complicated but are we allowed to like McGuyver stuff like take it apart and like make up okay
210.063:>>Person2>>yeah I don't see why not 
210.133:>>Person3>>yeah we have materials we can use them
213.329:>>Person1>>okay 
213.406:>>Person5>>so I actually put the matches at fifteen since it's 
215.38:>>Person3>>yeah there's no air
215.789:>>Person2>>okay the matches I put at thirteen yeah 
216.066:>>Person1>>because there's no oxygen yeah 
216.066:>>Person1>>see I had a lot of stuff where I didn't think I'd be able to use so I was just like our house number these I don't think any 
219.424:>>Person5>>stuff 
223.799:>>Person2>>yeah I don't think we did upgrade those any yeah so 
224.745:>>Person4>>wait I don't think we need a gun not that there's any aliens in this universe so 
226.35:>>Person5>>yeah so
226.995:>>Person1>>
229.108:>>Person5>>can we start making a list of things that are just completely useless they have no use we can see 
229.112:>>Person1>>
232.175:>>Person2>>yes so matches 
232.402:>>Person1>>yeah 
232.466:>>Person4>>okay
233.92:>>Person4>>right we don't need matches 
234.307:>>Person1>>matches pistols
235.548:>>Person5>>matches pistols compass
238.034:>>Person2>>pistols compass 
240.412:>>Person1>>oh could we
241.431:>>Person3>>what were you gonna say?
241.488:>>Person4>>well could we use a signal flare
242.018:>>Person1>>I was gonna say could we take the pistol apart and like to use 
244.172:>>Person3>>you could
245.011:>>Person1>>well I mean it doesn't say you have any fear all anything that 
245.011:>>Person2>>yeah this is all we have if you can 
245.102:>>Person4>>well we what it doesn't say we have any like materials to do that 
245.111:>>Person5>>we don't have any tools yeah
247.298:>>Person1>>oh anything to take it apart with okay okay
249.026:>>Person4>>yeah
249.052:>>Person3>>pistols you can take a pistol apart like field dress just with a gun you don't need tools I don't know but you can take it apart 
253.215:>>Person2>>but for what 
253.2981:>>Person5>>yeah 
253.319:Person2>>it I don't think that would make it anymore useful
255.121:>>Person1>>that's what yeah see that I have no I guess we should okay that's true I guess
255.832:>>Person4>>yeah 
258.233:>>Person5>>it only has a couple of parts in it
260.146:>>Person4>>it's two hundred miles so we need to 
262.24:>>Person1>>need to yeah we need to like be conservative
262.787:>>Person4>>yeah that's why I think like the food supply cause say like walking a mile takes fifteen minutes on earth so like in slow moving time you know it might be a little while 
264.462:>>Person2>>yeah
269.452:>>Person1>>right 
269.504:>>Person2>>right 
272.766:>>Person5>>yeah I estimated about fifty hours 
277.042:>>Person5>>being to go two hundred miles on a good day so that could be as long as like five or six days instead of two days
279.312:>>Person2>>okay 
283.627:>>Person1>>right 
284.063:>>Person4>>that's why I think the heater is important because the school bus is cold in space 
285.781:>>Person1>>yes 
285.99:>>Person3>>mhm
288.3:>>Person1>>moon is cold yup
288.519:>>Person5>>it could be far below zero
288.887:>>Person3>>another fun %HESITATION earth moon thing is that the hundred pound oxygen tanks would be sixteen pounds each 
294.727:>>Person2>>super light yeah
295.811:>>Person1>>yep one sixth of earth's gravity so that's that's easy
295.868:>>Person5>>yeah
299.653:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
299.738:>>Person3>>okay %HESITATION more disparity in the parachute silk those went from fifteen to eight 
305.057:>>Person2>>okay yeah why would you need that 
305.815:>>Person1>>no 
307.834:>>Person4>>I was thinking like a blanket 
309.156:>>Person3>>a blanket or a way to pack things up because you wrap everything up in a 
309.156:>>Person3>>parachute silk and you have a container 
309.49:>>Person1>>
312.292:>>Person2>>oh
312.437:>>Person1>>
315.705:>>Person5>>so is this the parachute itself 
318.128:>>Person3>>yes
318.249:>>Person5>>cause I was thinking the chord
319.848:>>Person1>>it's just so I mean just actual 
320.026:>>Person3>>no that would probably be the actual parachute 
322.922:>>Person1>>
324.815:>>Person2>>okay
325.378:>>Person3>>so this is a I guess a full parachute worth of
329.679:>>Person3>>fabric which is quite a bit 
330.184:>>Person5>>yeah
331.629:>>Person2>>okay 
332.454:>>Person3>>useful 
332.485:>>Person5>>I guess you can make something with it
333.641:>>Person4>>I'm okay like keeping that one lower %HESITATION
336.106:>>Person2>>yeah me too 
336.394:>>Person4>>I could see it going up too 
337.554:>>Person1>>yep 
337.653:>>Person3>>I think that's kind of it it's not useless and it's not essential one 
338.933:>>Person2>>it's yeah do you want to start from like the end like to rank the useless things like fifteen fourteen right now
340.915:>>Person1>>right 
340.929:>>Person5>>
346.306:>>Person4>>yeah I think %HESITATION
346.518:>>Person5>>yeah
348.415:>>Person3>>yeah 
348.787:>>Person4>>box of matches completely %HESITATION 
348.795:>>Person1>>all 
348.797:>>Person5>>well you could blow up the oxygen tanks but yes yeah  
350.081:>>Person3>>
352.727:>>Person1>>that's 
352.727:>>Person1>>go out with a bang okay 
352.727:>>Person1>>I was 
352.857:>>Person3>>
353.021:>>Person2>>so I'm fine with putting that fifteen 
353.224:>>Person4>>%HESITATION
355.597:>>Person3>>that I'm okay with
358.758:>>Person4>>I would say fourteen for magnetic compasses 
358.858:>>Person3>>
361.156:>>Person2>>okay yeah I agree with that 
361.589:>>Person1>>right 
362.878:>>Person4>>thirteen I guess for the guns I guess if you really want to off yourself and you don't want to suffocate to death but we don't need that
369.624:>>Person5>>yeah let's see 
369.672:>>Person4>>it's it's a little dark 
369.696:>>Person1>>let's let's be positive 
371.465:>>Person3>>yeah
373.354:>>Person5>>let's assume we succeed not that it really matters
374.085:>>Person2>>yeah I agree with the is everyone agreeing with the gun okay
374.348:>>Person4>>thirteen
376.569:>>Person1>>thirteen for the pistols okay 
376.81:>>Person4>>thirteen yes
378.815:>>Person4>>one for the oxygen tank 
380.467:>>Person5>>yeah 
380.742:>>Person3>>yeah 
383.98:>>Person2>>yes
383.992:>>Person3>>%HESITATION first aid kit was another one very low but we did have a good range from five to thirteen 
383.998:>>Person4>>
384.016:>>Person5>>
384.035:>>Person1>>yeah
387.653:>>Person5>>yeah 
391.548:>>Person3>>so 
392.433:>>Person5>>I figured the needles are absolutely useless 'cause it's not like you're having an allergic reaction 
394.268:>>Person2>>that's I'm confused about the needles 
396.842:>>Person1>>%HESITATION so is it like it happens it's like a normal first aid kit with like gauze strips it just happens to have needles
397.12:>>Person3>>
399.824:>>Person2>>normal first aid kit with needles yeah so the regular first aid kit could be pretty useful 
402.106:>>Person3>>so the regular 
406.031:>>Person1>>yeah so that's the rest of it 
406.163:>>Person3>>and I think it's safe to assume that nobody on this excursion is going have a pre existing medical condition that they would need injection for you're not gonna be on the moon with that 
410.937:>>Person1>>right you wouldn't make it to the moon in the first place 
411.435:>>Person2>>yeah right yeah 
412.366:>>Person5>>yeah 
414.954:>>Person2>>%HESITATION so I think that's important but I would definitely say like food and water is more important than the first aid kit 
419.458:>>Person1>>yes absolutely 
419.522:>>Person5>>realistically how do you get hurt on the moon would you like fall down break a leg or something 
423.374:>>Person5>>how is it 
424.916:>>Person3>>yeah 
425.22:>>Person1>>yeah 
426.641:>>Person3>>definitely possible
426.655:>>Person2>>isn't it hard it'd be harder to fall though
429.609:>>Person5>>well 
429.609:>>Person5>>yeah 
429.649:>>Person4>>well it would be in
430.965:>>Person1>>or you could like scrape your leg on a rock or something 
430.987:>>Person4>>slow motion 
430.989:>>Person3>>%HESITATION I I think it's fairly easy to fall because you rely on a lot of gravity and the motions to balance
434.062:>>Person4>>well you have your space suit on
434.069:>>Person5>>yeah I'm thinking your suit 
435.389:>>Person1>>that's true okay actually you would die before we need to worry about them
439.646:>>Person2>>okay 
439.657:>>Person5>>so the reason I ranked that low is I'm thinking your suit would fail before you got seriously hurt so
443.158:>>Person3>>yes I agree with that and anything that you could any serious injury probably wouldn't be treated with first aid kit
443.608:>>Person2>>yeah I agree with that yeah 
443.969:>>Person1>>okay 
449.385:>>Person2>>right 
449.594:>>Person5>>and that couldn't be used to patch up your suit either 
449.636:>>Person1>>that's true 
451.616:>>Person2>>all right okay so 
451.759:>>Person1>>oh yeah
452.598:>>Person4>>I'm okay putting that twelve
453.104:>>Person1>>that at twelvve
456.287:>>Person4>>that be the 
456.91:>>Person2>>twelve 
458.2:>>Person4>>fifteen fourteen thirteen twelve if we can't really use it 
459.455:>>Person2>>twelve 
459.529:>>Person1>>
460.241:>>Person3>>twelve is the next one
463.045:>>Person4>>because that's a good point because your suit's like pretty strong and
463.081:>>Person5>>I'm okay with that
466.943:>>Person2>>%HESITATION yeah 
467.026:>>Person3>>so it's worth noting that the life raft and parachute silk were rated very low on the initial rankings now that we've discussed the uses
467.255:>>Person1>>yeah
472.425:>>Person2>>yeah but now that we talked about it I I think that there's more use I had those both ranked pretty poorly 
473.967:>>Person1>>mhm
478.389:>>Person3>>okay so 
480.158:>>Person1>>yeah 
480.797:>>Person3>>don't put those near twelve is what you're saying
482.911:>>Person4>>yeah 
482.985:>>Person2>>yeah I'm okay with putting the first aid kit twelve
483.309:>>Person5>>yeah at least not right now 
483.712:>>Person3>>
486.101:>>Person5>>same
486.562:>>Person1>>okay
488.06:>>Person1>>
489.166:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
491.354:>>Person2>>and then I feel like we should work like toward the middle like we should work the lows and then the highs of this 
495.414:>>Person3>>let's 
496.689:>>Person3>>what do we think about taking a look at life necessities
500.306:>>Person2>>yeah 
500.415:>>Person3>>cause I think we can narrow down the top needs obviously air you can't survive without breathing
502.136:>>Person2>>yes 
502.15:>>Person1>>okay that's true air the other tanks that's number one 
502.181:>>Person5>>yeah 
503.796:>>Person4>>yeah number one 
505.49:>>Person2>>alright I think water would be number two 
506.048:>>Person4>>water 
506.088:>>Person5>>sure let's put that at two
506.819:>>Person3>>I think we know that water is next right
508.415:>>Person1>>you need can only survive four days without water 
510.739:>>Person5>>I think really everything in the top six is essential and you can't distinguish between them
510.947:>>Person2>>water for number two?
511.98:>>Person1>>yeah 
515.53:>>Person2>>yeah 
516.372:>>Person3>>mhm
516.872:>>Person1>>right 
517.695:>>Person4>>I think food number three 
517.792:>>Person3>>so 
517.855:>>Person5>>you can survive a week without food
519.189:>>Person3>>yeah 
519.294:>>Person2>>the 
519.401:>>Person1>>yep food concentrate 
522.844:>>Person4>>but you're not gonna have enough energy to keep moving quickly 
522.888:>>Person1>>
522.944:>>Person3>>
524.564:>>Person1>>that's yeah 
524.782:>>Person3>>we're trekking two hundred miles 
525.79:>>Person2>>where is that %HESITATION that's all the way the top three hundred 
527.788:>>Person5>>that's true
528.231:>>Person4>>yeah 
529.688:>>Person3>>that's like a week with absolutely no food like in a cave
532.405:>>Person5>>yeah I think that's fair
534.625:>>Person2>>three 
535.196:>>Person4>>yeah I think a map %HESITATION at 
535.261:>>Person1>>yeah
535.261:>>Person1>>I like that it's a stellar map so it's like the constellation so we assume we know how to read that 
535.261:>>Person1>>yeah okay 
535.29:>>Person3>>so 
540.582:>>Person5>>so 
542.206:>>Person4>>rational so we can 
542.821:>>Person3>>yeah 
542.821:>>Person3>>I'm pretty sure we  can
543.521:>>Person5>>well can we assume we've memorized the stars 
547.251:>>Person5>>like how how well do we know this
547.44:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
547.448:>>Person4>>that's 
547.551:>>Person5>>we're astronauts we get years of training on this 
553.319:>>Person2>>well 
554.251:>>Person1>>that's a 
554.405:>>Person4>>maybe it's the future and there is like a mother base on the moon but 
555.482:>>Person2>>with the how do we feel about like the signal flares and the %HESITATION
557.299:>>Person1>>that's true 
561.524:>>Person2>>solar powered FM receiver
564.066:>>Person3>>%HESITATION yeah 
564.623:>>Person4>>yeah 
564.902:>>Person5>>so
564.918:>>Person2>>I feel like those for me I thought those were more important than the map 
566.68:>>Person1>>what is 
566.726:>>Person5>>yeah 
568.748:>>Person1>>don't signal flares like burn so wouldn't you need oxygen
570.827:>>Person3>>they don't need oxygen you can fire 'em under water it's just a chemical reaction that doesn't use oxygen
574.244:>>Person5>>they're phosphor
575.157:>>Person1>>ohh okay I didn't you know that 
575.566:>>Person2>>because I feel like what how far away can you see from
579.628:>>Person3>>typically on earth the launch 
582.037:>>Person5>>in vacuum like as long as the horizon 
584.445:>>Person2>>okay so we can assume that the signal flare that you'd be able to see from two thou- two hundred miles
584.506:>>Person3>>yeah 
584.506:>>Person3>>that 
589.782:>>Person3>>I wouldn't say two hundred there's a lot of curvature there 
590.321:>>Person5>>eh no
590.385:>>Person1>>not cause like the horizon
592.324:>>Person5>>if you get lucky with the geometry maybe from like fifty miles away max
596.595:>>Person3>>if you're in the vicinity like retrievable vicinity I think it would be possible
600.846:>>Person4>>I think %HESITATION the map will be a little more important than that because we can get closer and then shoot the signal I think they're both important
601.435:>>Person2>>s
605.654:>>Person1>>right 
607.477:>>Person2>>what about the %HESITATION the radio 
608.702:>>Person5>>I'm not so convinced we need the map if like
611.13:>>Person4>>it'd be nice if we have a radio if we have a radio I don't know if we need the signal flare 
611.319:>>Person2>>yeah me too 
612.763:>>Person5>>I don't know 
613.986:>>Person2>>will the will the radio are you we assuming the radio will reach from two hundred miles from the area that's kind of far
621.778:>>Person4>>yeah 
622.225:>>Person3>>what do we know about radio waves
624.161:>>Person5>>%HESITATION they bounce off the atmosphere and there's no atmostphere so is this also a line of sight 
627.091:>>Person3>>yeah
627.643:>>Person1>>that's true
629.265:>>Person4>>we're cheating with MAU    
629.527:>>Person3>>well 
630.237:>>Person1>>hahaha
630.468:>>Person5>>haha
630.762:>>Person3>>what about AM versus FM trying to
634.199:>>Person3>>remember what it is 
636.304:>>Person1>>well I mean
636.31:>>Person4>>%HESITATION F. is like frequency 
637.481:>>Person3>>AM is able to penetrate buildings right or is it the other way
640.031:>>Person1>>yeah no no FM can penetrate buildings and cannot like if you drive under a bridge you can't hear because it's a longer 
643.137:>>Person3>>okay and why is that 
646.234:>>Person4>>alternating 
648.085:>>Person5>>no that's AM
651.255:>>Person1>>because frequency modulation
653.966:>>Person5>>so I don't know can we assume the radio is line of sight
654.014:>>Person1>>okay hm
657.782:>>Person5>>'cause that's a big assumption 
659.382:>>Person3>>with no atmosphere I think that's a good assumption
661.583:>>Person3>>there's nothing to keep it on a curve 
663.68:>>Person2>>okay so that's like not even that important anyway 
664.041:>>Person5>>that's a shame 
665.019:>>Person4>>unless it just keeps going forever 
666.484:>>Person5>>unless you can like bounce it off a space station or something
666.645:>>Person1>>
669.402:>>Person4>>it just keeps going
673.232:>>Person4>>well didn't they send like stuff into space like the like didn't they send messages into space was that with radio waves or 
679.285:>>Person5>>%HESITATION
679.994:>>Person1>>I think that was radio waves yeah 
681.103:>>Person3>>but you require a direct line between sending and receiving 
683.773:>>Person4>>ah
683.913:>>Person1>>oh
684.929:>>Person5>>and also you need a reflector of about the same size as the %HESITATION amplitude
692.693:>>Person1>>okay so 
692.972:>>Person3>>so in light of the atmospheric realization you guys think the receiver transmitter is very useful 
693.157:>>Person2>>okay 
700.33:>>Person5>>so yeah so I'd say %HESITATION receiver plus map is strictly better than flare
700.717:>>Person2>>not really 
700.747:>>Person4>>maybe not number four 
701.921:>>Person1>>not number four no
707.809:>>Person5>>because you can tell them exactly where you are on the map
711.198:>>Person2>>okay
711.319:>>Person1>>that's true 
713.373:>>Person5>>assuming it doesn't break
714.358:>>Person2>>so do we want the map
716.673:>>Person4>>wait like really fast though should we
716.673:>>Person4>>Matt had a good point about like the life raft 
716.673:>>Person4>>of %HESITATION if we need to go down slopes and stuff like that 
716.673:>>Person4>>is that more important than the map
716.673:>>Person4>>or less important
724.531:>>Person3>>mhm
727.481:>>Person5>>no
727.484:>>Person3>>no I don't think so
729.38:>>Person2>>I don't think it's as important as the map
730.862:>>Person5>>that's definitely a later thing
732.986:>>Person4>>well what what you're saying with the portable heater like I a 
735.836:>>Person1>>
735.882:>>Person3>>yeah I think the portable heater should be another very high priority 
737.422:>>Person2>>is it 
739.317:>>Person2>>yeah 
739.544:>>Person1>>'cause yeah 
739.583:>>Person4>>yeah I'm okay putting it like number four because %HESITATION it's very cold in space 
739.583:>>Person4>>but that I think you're right that needs to be coupled with the life raft because if you have a portable heater wouldn't the heat not %HESITATION it would it wouldn't be %HESITATION inside something so would it not really do much 
739.637:>>Person5>>yeah 
741.837:>>Person5>>you would first freeze
742.878:>>Person1>>yup 
743.515:>>Person3>>you're right 
743.669:>>Person2>>yeah you're right 
752.612:>>Person3>>we would get heated but not nearly as well 
752.768:>>Person1>>
755.616:>>Person2>>yeah 
755.842:>>Person3>>I don't know that it would last for a week or however long it took us
756.036:>>Person4>>yeah 
758.193:>>Person5>>you'd have to depend on finding like a lump of boulders or something
764.035:>>Person3>>so do you guys want to lump those together four and five 
766.771:>>Person1>>sure yeah I'd like to lump that's a good idea 
768.574:>>Person3>>'cause there definitely are the life raft would give you %HESITATION transportation shelter and carrying ability so it's a very multi purpose item 
773.992:>>Person1>>mhm
777.696:>>Person4>>and we don't need the rope 
779.15:>>Person2>>so heater at four 
779.319:>>Person5>>I don't know about that I think we need the rope still
781.112:>>Person3>>rope would be pretty useful for latching it yourself and tying it up 
783.705:>>Person3>>I think rope should be %HESITATION
788.384:>>Person2>>so portable heater number four 
788.571:>>Person1>>rope is essential for survival
789.356:>>Person4>>or it will 
791.375:>>Person3>>yeah just as a life necessity that makes sense 
793.708:>>Person1>>okay 
795.238:>>Person2>>%HESITATION and then a liferaft at five 
798.952:>>Person1>>life raft
800.972:>>Person4>>%HESITATION
803.732:>>Person4>>you want %HESITATION stellar map and signal flares as six and seven 
808.737:>>Person3>>I'm not sure about coupling those especially when you have something like rope that might 
814.209:>>Person3>>be very necessary for the journey not just being picked up 
817.834:>>Person4>>I still think %HESITATION the map is important so that we know where we're going
818.529:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
821.368:>>Person2>>I think the map is I think the map should be number six 
822.356:>>Person3>>I agree with that because 
822.684:>>Person1>>okay yeah I I put that at number six 
823.427:>>Person5>>so 
825.621:>>Person3>>
827.102:>>Person3>>leaving a journey up to memory 
827.168:>>Person5>>yeah I would put that
829.8:>>Person3>>seems really sketchy 
830.394:>>Person2>>yeah
830.731:>>Person4>>two hundred miles is a lot like it 
830.742:>>Person1>>yeah 
832.644:>>Person1>>you want to be extra safe six 
833.183:Person2>>so map at six?
834.252:>>Person4>>yeah this is 
834.292:>>Person5>>it is a stellar map though so you can tell like where on the moon you are it wouldn't show you the detailed features of the surface right
842.2:>>Person3>>mhm
843.536:>>Person2>>no
843.617:>>Person1>>it's 
843.649:>>Person3>>it'll give you orientation 
845.678:>>Person4>>which assuming with our training we know 
846.454:>>Person2>>right right 
848.89:>>Person4>>we have figure out 
850.581:>>Person5>>so a surface map would be incredibly useful because you can avoid dead ends and instead take detours
853.013:>>Person3>>yes
854.507:>>Person1>>we don't have those %HESITATION for some reason 
854.507:>>Person1>>that's the point 
857.198:>>Person4>>you had a good point with the rope that we could use it to avoid detours but can we can't we only use it once to avoid detours 'cause once it's tied on the top of like a cliff and say we shimmie down
857.701:>>Person5>>
859.717:>>Person2>>for the 
867.605:>>Person3>>I don't think we'd make that 
867.605:>>Person3>>decision to abandon our rope 
872.354:>>Person3>>I think we'd avoid doing that
874.345:>>Person4>>so we can't use that for detours so I don't know if that's too important 
874.358:>>Person1>>
878.18:>>Person3>>I mean if you let somebody at the top a cliff
878.354:>>Person2>>I think 
878.672:>>Person1>>depends on the detour
881.236:>>Person1>>that's true 
883.353:>>Person4>>how are you gonna tie it on top?
885.56:>>Person4>>lasso it you're on the moon haha you can just jump really high
886.007:>>Person5>>
886.31:>>Person1>>
890.51:>>Person1>>don't go to the top of a cliff 
893.393:>>Person2>>yeah 
893.619:>>Person1>>okay %HESITATION 
893.799:>>Person3>>okay
896.373:>>Person2>>I think the rope
896.478:>>Person3>>so 
898.432:>>Person3>>let's come up with a couple things that we're considering for position seven
902.09:>>Person2>>oh
903.239:>>Person3>>oh wow
903.252:>>Person4>>oh okay 
903.274:>>Person1>>oh okay
905.274:>>Person5>>well we got the top and bottom
905.869:>>Person4>>oh man I kinda want to finish now
907.137:>>Person1>>haha
