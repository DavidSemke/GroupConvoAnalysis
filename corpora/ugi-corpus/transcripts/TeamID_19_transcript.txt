1.649:>>Person1>>Okay, so, 
3.658:>>Person3>>Should  we just go down the list for each item,
5.617:>>Person1>>Yeah I,
6.348:>>Person3>>regardless of ranking?
7.956:>>Person1>>Yeah, I feel like, in general, the main thing we need to worry about is we're not sure how long it's going to take us to get, like, 
16.686:>>Person1>>to get to the the point that we need to be at. So, like, being able to just survive as the most important thing. 
24.416:>>Person3>>Agreed.
24.727:>>Person2>>Yeah, I agree. 
26.922:>>Person1>>I would think that the probably the thing most required for that is, I kind of ended up end up thinking as in how fast the, as kind of morbid but how fast would you, would you be, how long would you be able to last without this thing. So I would think probably want a oxygen as number one. 
40.149:>>Person3>>Right.
40.263:>>Person2>>Yeah.
43.166:>>Person3>>Like, irregardless of ranking, should would just go down the list, or?
47.197:>>Person1>>%HESITATION We can, yeah. 
50.499:>>Person1>>%HESITATION So do you wanna start from the top, I guess? 
52.854:>>Person3>>Yeah.
54.343:>>Person1>>I don't see in general much purpose for matches, 
58.936:>>Person2>>Yeah, neither did I.
59.739:>>Person3>>I agree.
60.211:>>Person1>>so I think we can just call that. Food is definitely going to be pretty important. 
60.961:>>Person2>>Alright.
67.154:>>Person3>>I agree. 
67.423:>>Person2>>Yeah.
67.941:>>Person1>>I would think after survival if we were trying to move, to like to get closer to the point instead of just contacting from where we are, that we would probably want things like rope and stuff like that. 
80.169:>>Person3>>Agreed. 
81.027:>>Person1>>So probably towards the middle, I would think. 
83.248:>>Person2>>Yep.
84.048:>>Person3>>I'd say high middle because after survival, mobility is important. 
85.667:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah. 
88.321:>>Person1>>I would put, 
89.826:>>Person1>>I would think low middle for something like the silk because it has uses but there are other, other things that are more clean. 
94.541:>>Person3>>Very situational.
95.68:>>Person2>>Yeah.
98.302:>>Person1>>I wasn't quite sure about the heating unit. 
101.376:>>Person2>>Yeah, 
101.979:>>Person1>>What did you guys think?
102.747:>>Person2>>well, we don't really know if we have if the suits are like well insulated or not, I guess. 
108.57:>>Person2>>I assume that they are. 
111.001:>>Person1>>Yeah %HESITATION 
112.047:>>Person1>>so I think we can probably, 
115.386:>>Person1>>I kind of ended up thinking that one just based on other things being more important. I think we can probably get away with out it. 
119.846:>>Person2>>Yeah.
120.407:>>Person3>>I feel like that's a creature comfort.
122.372:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
123.177:>>Person3>>After %HESITATION like survival, mobility then things like just 
128.022:>>Person3>>health, for like peace of mind. 
129.678:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
130.746:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I don't think we're going to need a lot of self defense. 
135.171:>>Person3>>%HESITATION Like my interpretation of that item is for an easy out, but, you know, suffocation actually you go unconscious first,
141.477:>>Person3>>so there's no real reason. 
142.434:>>Person1>>I, so yeah.Probably not, 
145.447:>>Person1>>it's not really central to survival at all though. 
150.16:>>Person3>>Agreed. 
150.202:>>Person1>>%HESITATION It would be, 
150.202:>>Person1>>like the, yeah, 
153.479:>>Person1>>and 
155.049:>>Person1>>I ended up thinking like the milk as being probably the least 
160.174:>>Person1>>important of the food and survival items we have. So there were some items that I thought were more important even though they weren't direct survival. 
161.873:>>Person2>>Yeah, same. 
162.404:>>Person3>>I agree.
170.703:>>Person1>>%HESITATION Oxygen we already talked about. 
174.592:>>Person1>>The map I put pretty high because I think it's actually the only way we can find our way around. 
181.892:>>Person3>>%HESITATION Yeah, I put that in the mobility category, 
184.023:>>Person2>>Yeah.
184.234:>>Person1>>Yeah, 
184.234:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
185.125:>>Person3>>so relatively high on the list. 
187.189:>>Person1>>yeah. Liferaft is mobility, so pretty high. 
190.626:>>Person3>>I don't understand what the life, like what is your interpretation of that mean? Is it like a dinghy or? 
191.974:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
193.36:>>Person1>>I, 
194.673:>>Person1>>I would think even if it was a dinghy, its purpose could be to carry stuff. I assume if we have things we have that the other stuff, yeah, that we could use some kind of combination of like of rope to pull the dinghy with
201.83:>>Person3>>So it could be a mobility item.
202.831:>>Person2>>Oh, okay.
208.633:>>Person2>>Interesting, okay.
209.125:>>Person1>>all of our stuff. 
210.064:>>Person3>>That's a good point. 
211.876:>>Person1>>I don't think the moon has a magnetic field so it's, the compass is basically useless. 
214.132:>>Person3>>There's no magnetosphere.
216.121:>>Person2>>Alright. 
218.483:>>Person3>>It's very situate, it's extremely situational to have a compass on the moon. 
218.527:>>Person2>>Yeah, I didn't think so. 
222.74:>>Person1>>Yeah. Water is definitely 
225.133:>>Person3>>Extremely important, it's a survival item. 
225.887:>>Person1>>of the, and it's the survival item that, yeah water is the item that is of the, between food and water you can go weeks without food. You can't go weeks without water. 
227.606:>>Person2>>I put water as number two.
229.62:>>Person3>>Yep.
229.811:>>Person2>>Yeah.  
234.062:>>Person3>>If it takes, yeah.
237.609:>>Person3>>You can't go a week without a water. 
239.546:>>Person1>>This is true. 
240.108:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
241.542:>>Person3>>Signal flares, I feel like can be useful if it's very sit, like in a very situational case where we get separated and need to communicate over long distances.
248.987:>>Person1>>Yes. 
249.187:>>Person3>>Providing that we don't have any communications, which is the last item on the list.
252.541:>>Person1>>I would think that signal flares, I think signal fires work without air. 
257.997:>>Person3>>I don't know what they burn but let's assume they work 
260.369:>>Person1>>I think most have an oxidizer, but I don't know. 
260.657:>>Person3>>because we have them. 
262.295:>>Person3>>Because I don't imagine using signal flare in enclosed station environment.  
265.294:>>Person2>>Yeah.
266.723:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
266.958:>>Person3>>So I'm assuming it works. 
268.272:>>Person1>>First aid kit could be useful, but it's situational of course, but 
272.353:>>Person2>>Yeah.
272.656:>>Person3>>I don't know how sterile the suits are,  
273.055:>>Person1>>I, I don't. 
275.396:>>Person3>>but I'm assuming a pretty sterile.  
276.545:>>Person1>>This is true, I think we can, 
278.525:>>Person1>>it, it'll, it's a good thing to have but it's also not 
278.726:>>Person3>>It's it's a low priority. 
283.481:>>Person1>>as important. And then receiver transmitter is probably our only way of communicating.
289.969:>>Person1>>Like, along, it's, well communicating, 
290.655:>>Person3>>Yeah, with each other, 
292.121:>>Person3>>because we're in near vacuum. 
294.512:>>Person1>>yeah, but %HESITATION 
294.566:>>Person2>>See, I don't know how, would that work in a vacuum like long distance? 
296.314:>>Person1>>it, it they're electromagnetic waves so they should travel through space. 
298.415:>>Person3>>Yeah, 
300.816:>>Person3>>they do,
301.202:>>Person2>>Oh okay, cool. 
302.311:>>Person1>>Yeah, so 
302.313:>>Person3>>and that's how they communicate on the actual moon. 
304.808:>>Person1>>I think that would be, 
306.788:>>Person1>>first for communication between each other but then also that's the longest distance form of communication we have to anyone else.
313.443:>>Person3>>True. 
314.338:>>Person1>>So like if we're trying to get their attention from 
317.558:>>Person1>>miles out we might be able to catch them. 
320.119:>>Person2>>Cool.
320.537:>>Person1>>Alright, so,
321.481:>>Person3>>So it seems like we all have real relative agreement. 
322.024:>>Person2>>Alright so we all agreed on the oxygen being one, and the water being two, so we might as well just put that down. 
327.638:>>Person1>>Definitely.
328.429:>>Person3>>Then I put 
330.648:>>Person3>>food as third 'cause that's the third most important like it goes, in my mind, oxygen, water well you need oxygen to survive minutes, you need water to survive days, then you need food to survive weeks. 
338.325:>>Person1>>Yeah.
338.705:>>Person2>>Yeah, I agree. 
340.667:>>Person1>>I was also thinking with food that even if we aren't going to die, that even if we wouldn't die from the 
340.667:>>Person1>>lack of food, it would still certain, and also our productivity in general, and probably a group mindset, 
349.531:>>Person3>>Hinder mobility. 
350.809:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
352.322:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
354.573:>>Person3>>Yeah.
355.76:>>Person1>>are somewhat important things. 
356.273:>>Person3>>I don't know about you but I'm Lunar Larry, I'm the peak of mental health. 
361.574:>>Person1>>I thought that the, my guess was either the map or the 
368.294:>>Person1>>FM receiver transmitter to be the next most important thing. Depending on if we're just trying to contact or if we're trying to get to where we're going, I think we're trying to get to where we're going.
376.653:>>Person3>>I had the FM receiver because I feel like it's important to coordinate.  
381.56:>>Person1>>This is also true. %HESITATION 
384.942:>>Person1>>Yeah I can I, I, I would I, I think would agree to that. 
388.641:>>Person3>>So, do we agree on FM radio for the fourth item? 
390.849:>>Person1>>Yeah.
391.568:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
393.848:>>Person3>>Any objections?
394.037:>>Person1>>I don't know, what do you think? 
396.123:>>Person1>>There might be other things here that are more important. 
403.612:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
405.212:>>Person1>>Yeah, so,  
406.575:>>Person3>>Four for FM. 
409.458:>>Person1>>Yeah. I think after that we should definitely put the map, though, because we need, 
414.576:>>Person1>>for five, because we definitely need to be able to
417.714:>>Person1>>know where we're going.
419.79:>>Person1>>And it's pretty easy to get lost.
423.043:>>Person3>>Yeah, the moon is kind of a bit samey, isn't it? 
425.124:>>Person1>>Yeah we won't have a lot of %HESITATION 
428.024:>>Person1>>other landmarks to go off of, so 
431.72:>>Person1>>knowing which way is north quote, unquote is probably helpful. 
436.649:>>Person3>>It is a %HESITATION stellar map so we're like navigating by %HESITATION constellations? 
440.092:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah.
440.42:>>Person3>>Okay.
441.781:>>Person1>>Which isn't that hard to do. 
444.83:>>Person1>>So, five for that, yeah? 
446.268:>>Person2>>Yeah.
446.533:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
451.112:>>Person1>>After that, 
454.856:>>Person3>>I'd say the nylon rope 'cause once we know where we're going we need to be able to navigate the landscape. 
459.474:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah. I would, I actually have that as six as well. 
463.119:>>Person1>>But %HESITATION what do you think?
464.579:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
468.053:>>Person3>>Like at least my logic behind that is like, if we are going in the right direction but we come across an impassable crater, or we need to ascend or descend a drop, 
474.921:>>Person2>>Right.
475.366:>>Person3>>we need to be able to navigate that obstacle. 
477.892:>>Person2>>That's true, yeah.
479.454:>>Person1>>So you agree?
479.486:>>Person3>>Like, does that logic? Okay, cool. 
480.789:>>Person2>>Sure.
484.035:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
484.035:>>Person1>>I think next I put %HESITATION I think maybe 
489.686:>>Person1>>milk, at this point. 
491.03:>>Person2>>Yeah, I was going to bring that up. How 
492.304:>>Person3>>I feel like milk is further down the list.  
495.143:>>Person2>>all it all it says is food concentrate. It doesn't say how much we have.
499.229:>>Person1>>Yeah, that is a good point. 
499.423:>>Person2>>So,
500.427:>>Person1>>I think it, it, while not as important as some of those other items, like the rope, I think having as much of the food as a high priority as possible. 
502.001:>>Person2>>I'm assuming,
510.062:>>Person2>>I'm assuming if, I'm assuming the food would all the stored together. 
511.104:>>Person3>>Just increase the available calories? 
518.474:>>Person2>>So if some of it's left over, then it's probably all left over. We probably have a lot of it, so I don't think the milk is too important. 
520.008:>>Person1>>No? Okay, yeah.
522.521:>>Person3>>Like, I I'm just wondering, does milk increase available calories significantly? 
527.087:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
529.102:>>Person1>>I think to some extent, yes, also considering it probably has the %HESITATION it has a very high amount of calories per 
537.45:>>Person3>>Weight, unit unit weight. 
537.506:>>Person1>>cubic,
538.668:>>Person2>>Well, so let's see what else, 
539.009:>>Person1>>for cubic centimeter.
540.163:>>Person2>>what else would have in this scenario then, first.
540.894:>>Person1>>Yeah, that's fine. 
541.207:>>Person3>>Okay. 
544.377:>>Person1>>Other than that I would put something like the 
547.541:>>Person1>>life raft or the first aid kit.
551.737:>>Person1>>I don't think the first aid kit is as important, because
555.77:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
557.076:>>Person1>>we can probably get away with
559.455:>>Person1>>what we're currently in. 
560.268:>>Person3>>It's a very low impact environment, I don't see us, like, 
563.272:>>Person3>>seriously injuring ourselves and, like, having an open wound.
566.88:>>Person1>>Yeah.
565.101:>>Person2>>That's true, it is very low impact.
568.903:>>Person3>>Cause not only are we in a very low momentum environment, we are also in very padded suits.
572.383:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
574.089:>>Person1>>Yes, so. 
575.898:>>Person3>>So possibly the life raft to start having some sort of, 
580.182:>>Person2>>So we can carry more stuff? Yeah.
580.796:>>Person3>>Yeah, so. 
582.727:>>Person1>>Yeah I I I I think yeah that's probably a little more important because we need it, if we have all this stuff, if we can't take it with us, then what are we gonna do?
592.15:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
592.957:>>Person1>>Okay, so that for seven?
594.203:>>Person2>>Yeah.  
594.444:>>Person3>>Life raft for seven? 
595.603:>>Person1>>Yep.
595.983:>>Person3>>Life raft for life! 
600.457:>>Person1>>After that I that 
600.48:>>Person3>>Then after that the milk?
602.162:>>Person1>>I definitely think we should put the milk higher in priority 'cause as many calories as we have as possible is. 
604.841:>>Person3>>I mean I
607.7:>>Person3>>I my cereal with water, but okay.
610.205:>>Person1>>Really? 
610.252:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
611.52:>>Person1>>Huh,
613.462:>>Person1>>interesting. 
615.409:>>Person1>>So we have that for eight? 
617.735:>>Person3>>I can't find it on the list. 
618.741:>>Person2>>%HESITATION So like, what else would be in this area?  
623.445:>>Person1>>I feel like, 
624.052:>>Person2>>Just so we have a
625.429:>>Person1>>I feel like I don't see anything else on this list being as important. 
627.734:>>Person2>>a good idea.
629.212:>>Person2>>As important? Let's see what we have, guns, heating unit, silk, matches, 
630.637:>>Person3>>I feel like the rest is pretty. 
633.492:>>Person3>>Maybe the heater next? 
636.02:>>Person2>>compass, 
636.726:>>Person1>>For nine, you mean? 
637.885:>>Person3>>For nine. 
637.889:>>Person2>>flares, 
639.417:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
639.441:>>Person2>>%HESITATION first aid kit, yeah. 
642.031:>>Person1>>I don't know I 
642.031:>>Person1>>think 
645.044:>>Person1>>maybe the, what do you think? Maybe the first aid kit or the %HESITATION, 
650.293:>>Person1>>I'm just listing things. The first aid kit, 
652.959:>>Person1>>the heater, or maybe the silk as just being a way of holding stuff.
656.677:>>Person3>>Like, my argument, or my logic for the heater is that, 
660.882:>>Person3>>like, if we're shivering we get less rest than if we're soundly asleep. 
667.021:>>Person1>>True, true.
667.348:>>Person3>>And if were exhausted than that enters both thought and mobility.
671.671:>>Person1>>Okay, yeah I I can agree with that. 
672.206:>>Person3>>So it's more like a creature comfort thing to get peak performance, in my mind. 
672.578:>>Person2>>That's true. 
676.371:>>Person1>>I I can agree with that, and 
676.41:>>Person3>>Whereas the first aid kit is more "in the event that something happens" rather than "this will happen if we don't deal with it".
680.93:>>Person1>>Right. 
683.049:>>Person1>>Right, okay yeah I I agree with that. 
684.551:>>Person2>>So
685.351:>>Person3>>So heating for nine?
687.006:>>Person1>>Yeah, I think then after that probably the silk for ten, if we're trying to make some kind of area for us to sleep. 
694.662:>>Person3>>%HESITATION Like, my interpretation was we could, like, sleep in a life raft. 
698.896:>>Person1>>Well yeah, but I mean like.
700.732:>>Person3>>And also like should we talk about the %HESITATION first aid kit again for?
703.962:>>Person1>>We can talk about that. 
704.681:>>Person2>>Yeah.
707.385:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
709.092:>>Person2>>Yeah, so you said sleeping area for the silk, or something to lay on. 
710.519:>>Person1>>I, 
712.849:>>Person1>>or 
714.206:>>Person1>>or just %HESITATION the %HESITATION the two things would be either that or just general 
720.068:>>Person1>>usage for 
721.848:>>Person2>>Yeah, so like what other uses do you see it holding. 
722.037:>>Person1>>holding things. 
724.428:>>Person1>>I mean, anything you have use for a large sheet 
728.03:>>Person1>>of something, 
730.823:>>Person1>>you could do a bunch of stuff with that. If we need to.
733.712:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I can I can understand the first aid kit, definitely. 
734.796:>>Person2>>Well, but like what's
736.754:>>Person2>>specifically, so that we have like a better idea of its importance
736.754:>>Person2>>for this scenario. 
740.84:>>Person2>>Cause you said like holding things, being able to sleep on it. 
745.046:>>Person1>>That would be pretty much the stuff, 
746.516:>>Person1>>and also if we're using the, 
751.188:>>Person1>>how how how, if we're using the heater, 
754.157:>>Person1>>how are we getting the heat to us, is my question? 
757.035:>>Person3>>I feel like that's an abstraction we're not supposed to dwell on, 
760.92:>>Person1>>Okay.
761.237:>>Person3>>other than the fact that it provides heat. 
763.011:>>Person1>>Well, I think if we're trying to make some kind of, like, 
766.921:>>Person1>>in in in in another situation we would probably want to have, 
771.798:>>Person1>>like, our shelter quote, unquote to also shelter us from the sun. 
777.204:>>Person1>>Because %HESITATION. 
780.227:>>Person3>>I mean there is no atmosphere so we are in spacesuits, though.
785.145:>>Person2>>%HESITATION Yeah don't the space suits protect you, though? 
786.349:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah.
786.937:>>Person3>>So, I can understand if we're taking a parachute silk to, like, make a yurt, so we can be like moon Mongols, 
792.609:>>Person3>>in which case, I feel like, 
795.232:>>Person3>>If the parachute silk is ins, like insulatory, then I feel like you can make an argument for it over the heater.
801.913:>>Person1>>Yeah, %HESITATION
802.521:>>Person2>>I think parachute silk is pretty thick. 
803.749:>>Person1>>I don't I don't think it's as important as the heater but I think it can be up there, like ten is seems reasonable for me. 
811.139:>>Person3>>Okay, so. 
811.214:>>Person1>>'Cause past that we have aid kit being somewhat situational. 
816.411:>>Person3>>Agreed. 
817.431:>>Person1>>Okay, so,
817.47:>>Person3>>So we should go with parachute silk and then first aid kit. 
820.793:>>Person1>>yeah, I agree with that. 
822.814:>>Person2>>Alright, yeah.
823.397:>>Person3>>Ten and eleven. 
826.268:>>Person1>>%HESITATION past that %HESITATION. 
832.831:>>Person2>>%HESITATION Signal flares, maybe? 
835.358:>>Person1>>%HESITATION Yeah, I don't think any of the other stuff is as useful as those. 
840.566:>>Person1>>Matches I would only be seen using it in a situation where a signal flare would function better. 
846.553:>>Person3>>Yeah,  
846.816:>>Person1>>Does that make sense? 
848.762:>>Person3>>And also I don't fire can work on on the moon with such low oxygen, 
851.032:>>Person2>>Yeah.
852.739:>>Person1>>Yeah, I think, 
852.755:>>Person3>>unless were, like, lighting inside of our helmet, in which case I have several questions. 
856.454:>>Person1>>I I think signal flares do have some kind of oxidizer, though, so they do function. 
861.773:>>Person1>>I don't think matches do but I'm pretty sure a signal flare does. 
863.404:>>Person3>>Yes, so I feel like the signal flares will function where the matches just won't in a vacuum. 
866.76:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah. 
868.713:>>Person1>>So, twelve for that.  
868.877:>>Person3>>So, twelve for signal flares.  
871.431:>>Person1>>Past that we have the compass, the matches, and the pistols.
875.433:>>Person3>>I feel like the compass may be useful just for, like, it has spare parts for other equipment. 
880.581:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I don't know how much in the way of parts it has ma other than a magnetic needle which I don't. 
885.298:>>Person3>>I'm just, like, thinking over the pistols and the matches, I feel like it has that extremely situational 
891.749:>>Person1>>I think 
891.761:>>Person3>>use over the other extremely situational items. 
894.704:>>Person1>>there is slightly more use in the pistols,
897.62:>>Person2>>Yeah, I think so too.
898.527:>>Person1>>'Cause well I already know that %HESITATION. 
903.297:>>Person1>>It's time?
