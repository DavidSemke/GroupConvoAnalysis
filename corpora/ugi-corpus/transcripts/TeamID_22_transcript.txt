4.09:>>Person1>>Okay, so.
7.29:>>Person1>>I guess we just need to get a starting point.  What did you guys put as your first thing?
10.28:>>Person3>>I put the oxygen. 
12.42:>>Person2>>Same.
12.6:>>Person4>>Same.
14.26:>>Person2>>Yeah you gotta try to survive, right, before you can get there?
14.53:>>Person1>>Yeah, okay.
16.31:>>Person3>>Right.
16.52:>>Person1>>Yeah.
18.34:>>Person2>>So, can mark that as one.
21.95:>>Person3>>Yeah.
22.99:>>Person1>>I kind of- I kind of went on the basis of like so what do you need to actually like survive like even the first minute and then hour and then the day and then like, from that point on like- 
29.66:>>Person3>>Yeah.
29.73:>>Person4>>Right, that makes sense, yeah. 
30.64:>>Person2>>Same.
32.49:>>Person1>>Cause the- the end goal is to make it- So if you wanna get there, you have to survive as long as you can, so boom.
37.25:>>Person2>>Right.
40.64:>>Person2>>So then the second thing I had was water.
42.99:>>Person3>>Yeah, I put water too.
43.14:>>Person1>>I had the five gallons of water as well.
45.14:>>Person4>>I had magnetic compass, but I guess I'm in agreement with water too. Water was anyway pretty high, in my, it was in three.
53.48:>>Person1>>As your third one? Okay, what was the reasoning for the, putting the magnetic compass at two?
54.45:>>Person3>>Okay, yeah.
57.81:>>Person4>>I was like, we're two hundred miles away, right? So, if we don't know which direction to move, then we can't even start moving towards the mother ship.
67.53:>>Person3>>Right.
68.79:>>Person1>>Yeah, okay. 
70.76:>>Person5>>%HESITATION for me I had for my number two I had stellar map.  Same reason as him I thought that you could survive around three days without water but since you are only two hundred miles away maybe you should try to get to the point, so you need like a navigational system to get there. And hope that maybe um you'll last three days while you do it. But I agree with you guys about how important water is, water was my third choice, so I guess I'll go with water as number 2.
101.02:>>Person1>>Consensus in two? Okay.
101.76:>>Person2>>Yeah.
109.13:>>Person1>>Okay, so both you guys had water as your third choice, so.  
111.53:>>Person4>>Yeah.
112.53:>>Person5>>Yeah.
113.39:>>Person1>>So then are you technically switching? So, so what did you guys have?  
113.44:>>Person3>>Right.
118.85:>>Person4>>My second choice? 
119.49:>>Person1>>Yeah.
120.53:>>Person4>>Second choice was magnetic compass. 
122.56:>>Person5>>Mine was stellar map.
124.64:>>Person1>>Okay, as my third I had the food concentrate.
127.01:>>Person2>>So did I. 
127.81:>>Person3>>Yeah, I had food concentrate, just in case like. 
128.61:>>Person2>>I think the three of us are very focused on survival. 
130.86:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
133.88:>>Person1>>Basically need to be able to breathe, then you need water and food and then you kind of go on from there.
136.39:>>Person3>>Yeah.
140.28:>>Person1>>So, you guys had all map components. We had food. 
143.4:>>Person1>>Yeah.
143.69:>>Person4>>Map and compass, yeah.
144.88:>>Person5>>Yeah.
148.98:>>Person1>>So, how do we come to a decision on this?
153.44:>>Person1>>I guess arguing points, like.
156.21:>>Person5>>My point is that you could survive at least like few days without food right? As as long as you had water.
160.83:>>Person1>>You do make a good point, yeah. Like water you don't need for a considerable amount of time.
161.16:>>Person4>>Yeah.
163.9:>>Person5>>Yeah water is important, so is oxygen, but food it's not as important.
167.69:>>Person1>>Yeah, you can survive for a considerable amount of time. 
169.34:>>Person5>>Yeah.
176.09:>>Person1>>Thing is- thing is for me, I'm, just because, just because of that might- 
176.13:>>Person3>>So you're saying, stick to the task, more like?
179.67:>>Person3>>You're saying, stick to the task, more than.
185.32:>>Person5>>Because if you don't have don't have the navigational stuff but you have food, maybe you're going to just waste time and run out of food, and then at the end, just.
185.54:>>Person1>>Just get there.
189.9:>>Person4>>Yeah, you travel to a different direction.
190.45:>>Person3>>Right.
193.62:>>Person5>>Yeah.
194.97:>>Person1>>Okay.
197.74:>>Person1>>Cause for me I had %HESITATION basically the the map the map and the compass, those were, those are my ninth and tenth. 
208.53:>>Person3>>My-
208.53:>>Person4>>Mine map was tenth, but my compass was like second.
208.64:>>Person1>>Cause.
209.31:>>Person2>>Those are-
214.61:>>Person3>>My compass was fourth.
216.69:>>Person2>>Oh I had it as like eleventh and twelfth. 
219.24:>>Person1>>Okay so somewhat close.
223.89:>>Person2>>So I guess like my mindset was that %HESITATION I'm not sure how long it would take me to fix the mechanical difficulties in order to continue the trip, which is why I was focused on surviving as long as possible.
237.09:>>Person1>>I kind of went on the same thing, you just need the most amount of time. So what what can prolong your amount of time that you survive and that's just kind of what I went off of. 
240.53:>>Person2>>Yeah.
246.17:>>Person3>>Right.
246.18:>>Person5>>My fourth choice was portable heating because I thought that you were in outer space, so you need heating to survive, because you're probably going to survive like a really short period of time if you don't have like the heating, to, you know, survive.
258.1:>>Person3>>Did we choose three, yet?
258.38:>>Person4>>However, I was thinking there's like some food concentrate, some milk or something.
259.48:>>Person2>>That was five for me.
264.83:>>Person1>>Yeah there was dehydrated milk. 
266.21:>>Person4>>Yeah, so we can like put one of the food items on a high rank and put one on a lower rank. So that we can optimize, I guess.
276.45:>>Person3>>Yeah.
276.83:>>Person1>>Okay, I put I put the dehy- I put the food concentrate pretty high up there just because the fact that like the dehydrated milk you need you need water to rehydrate the milk to be able to like take it in.
284.73:>>Person2>>Yeah.
285.22:>>Person5>>Yeah, that's true.
285.24:>>Person3>>Yeah.
285.31:>>Person4>>Yeah.
285.83:>>Person2>>I had a dead last.
287.23:>>Person3>>(Laughter)
287.31:>>Person5>>(Laughter)
289.45:>>Person2>>I'm also lactose intolerance, so. 
290.82:>>Person4>>(Laughter)
290.87:>>Person1>>Yeah there's that too. 
291.0:>>Person3>>(Laughter)
293.52:>>Person3>>Yeah.
293.92:>>Person1>>Okay so %HESITATION on third component then. 
301.03:>>Person1>>We need to come-
302.91:>>Person5>>So for navigation, which one is more important? The map or the compass?
306.7:>>Person4>>The stellar map is the one, I mean, you. 
310.86:>>Person5>>I was confused. So, by stellar map, is it like the map of like the surface or the map of?
314.68:>>Person4>>It is the map of the part of the moon, which is getting hit by the sun.  It is a time dependent map.
316.43:>>Person5>>Ok, yeah. I was kind of confused.
320.9:>>Person4>>This part of the moon will be enlightened, it will be bright, today, tomorrow it will be a little shifted, that variation is in the map.
324.53:>>Person5>>Okay.
331.62:>>Person5>>Yeah then I guess the compass will be more important than that.
334.07:>>Person4>>The compass will be like instantaneous, you need to know the direction.
337.42:>>Person2>>Oh.
338.72:>>Person4>>So I think we can keep food third and compass fourth.
341.73:>>Person3>>Yeah, I agree on that.
341.76:>>Person2>>Yeah.
342.66:>>Person5>>Okay.
342.85:>>Person1>>Okay.
353.23:>>Person1>>Okay.
356.07:>>Person3>>Fifth I choose heating unit. 
358.52:>>Person3>>Cause if you, you're going to spend the night there-
360.23:>>Person4>>It-
362.37:>>Person2>>Yeah, I agree with that.
364.37:>>Person3>>Well depending on the moon's rotation.
367.07:>>Person2>>Well, it's just, yeah it's very cold that's why.
367.31:>>Person3>>Yeah yeah yeah it's still gonna be cold.
367.31:>>Person5>>It's very cold, it's very cold.
368.34:>>Person4>>Yeah, yeah mine is also heat is fifth.
372.57:>>Person1>>Okay, so that my my fifth and my fifth and sixth were um- my fifth was the the pistol-
378.45:>>Person5>>Why was you're uh?
379.18:>>Person4>>Why?
379.3:>>Person3>>We don't need pistols though.
381.2:>>Person1>>Survival instinct, I don't know. The second, the second you touchdown you don't actually -  if you're - you don't, what is it. 
387.21:>>Person5>>Aliens?
387.88:>>Person1>>You're just in, you're in a completely new environment so.
388.18:>>Person3>>(Laughter)
388.31:>>Person4>>(Laughter)
392.5:>>Person4>>But pistols won't help me. 
393.16:>>Person5>>Why would you need a pistol?
393.19:>>Person1>>But, but my, the sixth thing was matches, thinking of uh, of heat but in retrospect- Actually no wait no, I had box of matches as sixth and my seventh was the portable heating unit. 
404.15:>>Person5>>I had matches for fourteenth because matches it's fire so it's gonna conceive your oxygen.
410.22:>>Person2>>Oh, that's a good point.
410.33:>>Person1>>Oh good point is you have that's a good point.
410.38:>>Person5>>Yeah, that's what I thought. And you have the heating unit so why would you need the- you have the heating unit so why would you need the fire?
413.47:>>Person1>>You have a good point.
413.55:>>Person3>>Will they even light up?
416.09:>>Person4>>And, you are like, landing on the lightened surface, lightened part of the moon, yeah, the bright part, it says.
424.11:>>Person1>>See you-
424.74:>>Person4>>Yeah.
426.51:>>Person5>>Dark side.
427.19:>>Person4>>No not that dark side. 
428.34:>>Person5>>Light side so you don't need light.
429.06:>>Person4>>Yeah. Yeah.
431.0:>>Person3>>Yeah.
433.43:>>Person4>>So now I remembered that I put box of matches at six so I think it should be lower.
433.52:>>Person1>>Okay.
440.61:>>Person2>>I also have matches at six.
441.52:>>Person4>>So, I think we can agree on portable heating unit at five?
444.04:>>Person1>>I concur, you have to make it through that first night, so.
444.35:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
444.37:>>Person5>>Yeah, okay.
444.43:>>Person2>>Yeah.
454.14:>>Person3>>I had rope for six.
458.06:>>Person5>>What's your reasoning?
458.21:>>Person3>>You're gonna, there's craters on the moon, you have to get through, down through, down and up, you have to get through, so.
463.34:>>Person5>>That's true.
469.61:>>Person5>>But there's like no gravity, it's very low gravity so you don't need to like climb it, you can just jump, right? You can just hop, and- 
470.89:>>Person3>>If you-
473.3:>>Person4>>Well you can jump.
478.42:>>Person5>>You don't really need the rope.
478.61:>>Person4>>(Laughter) 
478.62:>>Person3>>(Laughter)
483.3:>>Person1>>As just like a basis, where did you guys put your- 
485.3:>>Person5>>So we're talking about the sixth item.
485.43:>>Person3>>But if you do them.
485.48:>>Person4>>This is the height of the scenario.
488.85:>>Person1>>Ah yea, six- But just like where did you guys put your signal flares and your FM transmitter? 
489.66:>>Person2>>Yeah.
494.8:>>Person5>>My FM was pretty high.
495.67:>>Person2>>Pretty high, both pretty high for me.
497.73:>>Person3>>Mine was eight. 
498.69:>>Person4>>Seven and eight.
499.84:>>Person3>>Yeah.
501.8:>>Person1>>Okay, I went very much on you gotta survive though. It's pretty low there, like thirteenth. 
506.64:>>Person5>>I guess you need the signal flare as you like approach closer to the mother ship, so they can see you, so-
512.23:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
513.88:>>Person1>>Yeah, can survive the task. 
513.94:>>Person5>>But you need the receiver while you're like pretty far so you know like what you're doing from like the mother ship so. 
520.72:>>Person5>>I feel like the communication system should be more important than the flare.
523.95:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
524.23:>>Person2>>Yeah, I agree with that.
525.4:>>Person5>>So, six should we do FM transmitter, receiver?
529.79:>>Person3>>I mean, you can't, you can't jump through, down through a crater.
532.8:>>Person1>>But-
534.21:>>Person3>>If you jump high you you just go off the moon.
535.14:>>Person5>>What if we don't land in a crater, what if it's just flat surface?
540.33:>>Person2>>(Laughter)
540.38:>>Person1>>Well what did you guys have as like six and seven?
540.61:>>Person4>>(Laughter)
544.44:>>Person2>>Uh, I had the matches and the flares.
547.82:>>Person2>>Just because like, I I had like the thought of, oh well if it's gonna take me much longer to get there than someone else to, who is more better equipped than me, to come to me, to help me, then I thought that it might be important for them to know where I am, or like be able to see where I am.
557.43:>>Person1>>Yeah.
561.32:>>Person1>>Okay.
564.91:>>Person1>>What did you guys put?
566.26:>>Person4>>My six is also matches but I'm kind of willing to let it go.
570.65:>>Person4>>And seven was for the FM receiver or submitter.
577.95:>>Person1>>Okay.
579.19:>>Person1>>That was rope? Oh yeah sorry, I wasn't listening. Okay, rope.
579.32:>>Person3>>Mine was rope.
580.15:>>Person2>>(Laughter)
584.21:>>Person2>>You want to walk, or leap through the moon, all two-hundred miles on your rope?
586.92:>>Person5>>(Laughter)
590.5:>>Person5>>So are we going to walk to the destination or are we gonna fix the spaceship and then go there?
594.54:>>Person2>>Yeah that's, that's part of it too, right?
595.29:>>Person5>>Because if we were gonna walk I think one of the like the items in the list should be spacesuit it but it's not there so I thought that maybe-
602.59:>>Person2>>You would repair the, right.
603.53:>>Person5>>Yeah.
604.91:>>Person4>>So I mean it's a spaceship right, so even if we repair it, we'll have to take off and then land again two hundred miles apart.
613.36:>>Person1>>Mhm.
613.57:>>Person4>>That is the scheme we're looking for? 
616.23:>>Person1>>I think I think what we-
617.34:>>Person4>>We won't get the fuel as well, takeoff takes some fuel.
621.78:>>Person1>>Yeah.
621.79:>>Person5>>It said mechanical problems so I'm thinking maybe it's like, maybe something over-heated or something, it's not a fuel problem that's, that was my, that was my
629.05:>>Person4>>Fuel is over, that's my point, fuel is already done because we have traveled from us to moon or something.
631.02:>>Person1>>because it 
633.94:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah.
633.98:>>Person5>>But there's still two hundred miles to go, so there's still some fuel left, right?
637.65:>>Person1>>I feel like what we're supposed to assume is like that it's like a terminal failure. There is, there is- 
637.84:>>Person4>>Not-
637.86:>>Person3>>No, not- yeah. It just, you can't get-
640.3:>>Person5>>Oh, so there's no way you can get the thing so you have to walk all the-
640.65:>>Person2>>Aw, terminal failure, aw. 
645.22:>>Person1>>Because like we have our fifteen items, and we have to ration out our fifteen items to help us do to get there.
648.03:>>Person5>>Yeah, that makes sense.
650.15:>>Person5>>Yeah it crashed on it so yeah. Okay.
651.91:>>Person4>>For some kind of mechanical things, things fall apart, then rope can be handy to like give a temporary solution, bind them together, stacked them. 
661.52:>>Person5>>Can we talk about the %HESITATION the two pistols? Because I feel like for me it was fifteen because why would you-
665.53:>>Person4>>For me also it's fifteen.
667.56:>>Person2>>It's also fourteen for me.
668.58:>>Person1>>Yeah and don't think about it you're on the moon. 
668.98:>>Person5>>Like, what was your reasoning?
668.99:>>Person3>>I'd put- 
674.12:>>Person1>>Dumb reason, I take that back.
675.3:>>Person2>>Just wanted to feel protected.
676.71:>>Person3>>(Laughter)
676.93:>>Person4>>(Laughter)
677.07:>>Person1>>Pretty much.
680.53:>>Person1>>But on, on second thought it's the moon so we're good.
682.79:>>Person5>>So, fifteen for two pistols? Consensus?
684.61:>>Person4>>So.
686.51:>>Person4>>I guess so.
687.22:>>Person2>>Sure.
688.2:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
688.5:>>Person4>>What was the pistol's ranking, twenty?
691.1:>>Person3>>No, mine was thirteen.
692.98:>>Person1>>Okay. 
693.27:>>Person4>>I think we can agree on fifteen.
693.59:>>Person5>>What was your fifteen?
695.38:>>Person3>>My fifteen was life raft. 
698.95:>>Person4>>What is life raft anyway?
700.62:>>Person2>>Yeah I don't really understand %HESITATION like is it like the inflatable, like that's what I think. 
702.68:>>Person5>>(Laughter)
704.62:>>Person3>>Yeah that's what I thought it was.
705.33:>>Person1>>Like the big yellow inflatable boat. Yeah.
707.77:>>Person4>>Oh. 
708.74:>>Person2>>Why would you have that on a spaceship? 
709.39:>>Person5>>Exactly, why would you have that on there?
709.46:>>Person4>>(Laughter)
709.88:>>Person3>>I don't think so.
712.8:>>Person2>>(Laughter)
713.52:>>Person1>>Oh, no, no, no it's-
714.23:>>Person5>>What if it's like a smaller like like a module of your spaceship? So you could like eject from it, and then, like maybe- 
723.06:>>Person5>>That's what I thought. Because there's no way it's like a normal life raft. Because-
723.12:>>Person1>>Because I like, I know sometimes they have those, they have those for landings and stuff, if you're coming from like a mountain of some sort.
724.63:>>Person2>>Yeah, that's what I thought it might be.
727.52:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
728.43:>>Person2>>Yeah.
731.34:>>Person1>>I had- So like, I guess we can try to go from maybe the bottom the top, to the top. I had like at the bottom I had the silk and then like, the the liferaft.
740.65:>>Person3>>I had the silk, I definitely had the silk, and yeah life raft, yeah.
743.12:>>Person5>>What's the silk? Is it just like the-
746.33:>>Person1>>Parachute silk, so like-
747.66:>>Person3>>Parachute, it's like when you're.
748.81:>>Person5>>Just the parachute, without like the.
748.81:>>Person1>>Just to slow down 
752.8:>>Person3>>It's gonna slow you down. 
753.48:>>Person1>>Where did you guys have it? 
755.38:>>Person4>>Yeah my silk thing was fourteen.
758.08:>>Person3>>Yeah.
758.16:>>Person2>>My silk was nine but I like honestly I think at this point in the ranking I wasn't sure what I was going to do with any of these things anyway, so.
762.9:>>Person5>>Yeah.
764.37:>>Person5>>Yeah, because I just thought that we had like all the necessities so all these other things could just, yeah.
767.25:>>Person2>>Yeah.
768.93:>>Person2>>Didn't matter as much.
771.21:>>Person1>>Like I kept thinking about the silk, but like and, the only and the only like helpful reason I can see for it is like having it as like clothing to keep warm, I guess.
781.1:>>Person5>>I thought the silk and rope were like two parts of the parachute. So there's the rope so you can attach yourself to like the silk, which is like the like canopy, that's what I thought.  
781.75:>>Person2>>Yeah.
782.24:>>Person3>>Yeah.
789.7:>>Person1>>Okay.
794.25:>>Person4>>Okay so the two things that are like absolutely useless are life raft and pistols I guess.
796.67:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
800.96:>>Person1>>Yeah so pistol is fifteen.
802.03:>>Person5>>Which one's more useless?
802.21:>>Person3>>Yeah.
802.26:>>Person4>>(Laughter)
804.34:>>Person5>>Pistol?
804.36:>>Person1>>I put pistol as fifteen. 
805.19:>>Person3>>I would say pistol, then, yeah.
806.68:>>Person5>>Okay, yeah, pistol's fifteen.
807.1:>>Person2>>Yeah.
807.38:>>Person4>>Yeah.
808.92:>>Person5>>So life raft is fourteen.
809.09:>>Person3>>I mean, if there is a quarrel between us, you know?
814.18:>>Person2>>(Laughter)
814.26:>>Person1>>Finish it quickly.
815.73:>>Person5>>(Laughter)
816.12:>>Person2>>Oh, man.
818.34:>>Person1>>Someone gets injured- 
820.18:>>Person3>>(Laughter)
821.81:>>Person3>>Yeah.
822.02:>>Person1>>Okay so life, so are we, do we think that life raft should be fourteen 
822.9:>>Person5>>If it gets messy.
828.22:>>Person2>>Yeah.
830.9:>>Person3>>Yeah.
833.46:>>Person1>>Okay.
835.34:>>Person5>>Now that I think about it I feel like the stellar map is also pretty useless.
840.95:>>Person2>>Not necessarily, um because it - you told us it was a time, like basically a clock, right? So-
846.39:>>Person4>>It shows a map of like where the light will be. I mean where they will-
851.11:>>Person2>>Yeah.
851.43:>>Person5>>The constellation? So like what stars you can see from your surface so you can determine like-
855.06:>>Person4>>Yeah, yeah.
856.34:>>Person5>>Okay yeah, okay nevermind, okay then that's pretty important.
856.7:>>Person2>>Oh.
857.5:>>Person4>>Because if you are on the dark side of the moon it's over.

862.83:>>Person4>>It won't be forever, it won't be there forever.
864.1:>>Person5>>That's true.

883.1:>>Person5>>Okay so that consensus for six?
884.98:>>Person1>>Cause we, we have the heating so, to survive, and then we already have the compass itself, I think the map would be a good would be a good next like important point.
886.25:>>Person2>>Yeah.
889.61:>>Person3>>Yeah.
892.01:>>Person5>>Six, okay.
