4.155:>>Person2>>I was just just a little bit confused whether we're trying to reach the mother ship or survive the longest amount of time  
6.443:>>Person1>>yeah 
12.63:>>Person3>>I think yeah I think reach the mother ship but you have to like survive in order to reach the mother ship 
19.55:>>Person1>>this is  200 miles
21.178:>>Person3>>yeah 
23.132:>>Person3>>so I think the main priority in the beginning it's just survival because it doesn't matter if you get there if you are not alive
29.92:>>Person3>>you know
30.485:>>Person2>>right %HESITATION I am just guessing what the like the time span is a few hours versus days that we have to survive
37.227:>>Person3>>I guess since like since it is indefinite I guess I'd rather err on the side of like have 
43.19:>>Person3>>too much survival stuff than like two little because you know it could be a week it could be months we don't know how long 
48.709:>>Person2>>really I tied it for just about the time that we need so like if we need three days worth of survival 
56.339:>>Person2>>don't worry about the food because you can survive three days without food
57.983:>>Person3>>that is why 
61.645:>>Person3>>yeah how do you know so 
64.537:>>Person2>>he got a 
65.183:>>Person1>>there's no mention of 
67.567:>>Person1>>then don't have a vehicle
70.348:>>Person1>> so mostly they are walking 200 miles
72.781:>>Person1>>if you take a speed of 4 miles per hour
76.761:>>Person2>>four miles
76.824:>>Person1>>have fifty hours to walk
79.476:>>Person3>>yeah 
80.121:>>Person1>>so so you need you need to have breaks
80.121:>>Person1>>atleast four times
84.919:>>Person3>>yeah you need to slow down you know you can't walk 
84.919:>>Person3>>200 miles continuously
93.035:>>Person2>>Sorry did you save fifty how many miles you can go into 
97.837:>>Person1>>four four miles per hour
97.909:>>Person3>>well my 
99.338:>>Person2>>walking for 
100.968:>>Person1>>fifty hours so four days
103.383:>>Person2>>four 
105.029:>>Person2>>any stretch it out to a week 
105.319:>>Person1>>sorry fifty hours so two days
110.813:>>Person2>>so 
112.79:>>Person2>>let's let's err on the side of everybody just walking so we are we're not gonna a have large injuries 
112.79:>>Person2>>that's not the problem I think stretching out for a week is an important part 
113.622:>>Person3>>yeah agree very 
113.622:>>Person3>>I think stretching out 
114.454:>>Person1>> hmm
124.35:>>Person3>>yeah 
125.067:>>Person2>>so 
126.267:>>Person2>>like 
127.758:>>Person2>>of course water is important but like 
127.783:>>Person3>>water or 
131.038:>>Person2>>so you could have a few but maybe not 
134.03:>>Person2>>the dehydrate milk 
134.453:>>Person3>>yeah exactly like I 
138.077:>>Person3>>I think food and water probably the 
138.077:>>Person3>>most important of all this but literally food and water like that dehydrated milk and all that's I mean it's like a luxury since you don't need that like that's probably less valuable than like the map or something or 
155.182:>>Person3>>the rope you know 
156.347:>>Person1>>before food or water oxygen should be the first priority
160.524:>>Person3>>yeah no yeah you're right if you can't breathe and you're done 
160.524:>>Person3>>okay so do agree one is oxygen right 
163.936:>>Person2>>right so 
165.233:>>Person1>>yeah 
167.155:>>Person2>>right yeah 
170.952:>>Person1>>second comes water or food
172.779:>>Person3>>I say water right you live longer without food than water
178.912:>>Person3>>and then third is food concentrate
181.235:>>Person2>>yeah 
181.659:>>Person3>>and then the dehydrated milk will hold off on that because I don't think that's a priority 
187.045:>>Person1>>yes because you have to sacrifice water to hydrate the milk
187.782:>>Person1>>and then consume it
191.275:>>Person3>>yeah exactly 
193.836:>>Person2>>interesting two hundred pound tanks of oxygen that doesn't sound like a lot actually but 
199.539:>>Person3>>better than no oxygen yeah 
201.561:>>Person1>>yeah better 
202.819:>>Person2>>I am yeah it's better than no oxygen but our limit to 
205.58:>>Person1>>we don't know how many or the crew size
209.212:>>Person3>>yeah 
209.212:>>Person3>>and I also saying I think it is rather important %HESITATION and correct me if I am wrong I might be wrong the solar powered FM receiver transmitter that's so they can communicate with people right 
209.212:>>Person3>>I think that's relatively important as well on so that people know that 
210.495:>>Person1>> ya so
226.338:>>Person3>>they didn't like they you know the ship crash 
227.723:>>Person1>>they're they're few items for navigation 
232.978:>>Person1>>like the stellar map
233.996:>>Person3>>yeah well the map is really important
233.996:>>Person3>>yeah 
237.162:>>Person1>>so you put navigation first or communication firsst
240.367:>>Person3>>I guess probably navigation because by the time you communicate by the time people would come to you it might be too late 
247.178:>>Person2>>and I think our goal is to go and not to be found
247.549:>>Person3>>I'm not 
250.971:>>Person2>>so 
251.008:>>Person3>>yeah exactly and if if we can figure out the map and all that and we would need to communicate 
257.396:>>Person1>> yeah
258.795:>>Person2>> right
259.298:>>Person1>>I don't think compass would be useful because 
261.975:>>Person3>>I don't think that is useful
262.821:>>Person1>>Moon does not have a magnetic field
264.78:>>Person3>>yeah I think that's probably the least important out of everything because it is useless
265.569:>>Person1>> so can we agree on the stellar map as the fourth one
265.756:>>Person2>> yeah
273.242:>>Person3>>yeah I agree on that 
275.925:>>Person2>>thats four yeah
281.938:>>Person3>>do you want to just do wanna just for the compass last because we know doesn't work 
282.776:>>Person1>>yeah
287.697:>>Person3>>yeah 
289.393:>>Person3>>right it doesn't work 
293.134:>>Person1>>we can make it fifteen or can we use the compass for something else 
298.497:>>Person2>>I mean you can't get your bearings on a map without compass
303.013:>>Person2>>can you use a map without knowing the map north
305.973:>>Person3>>both of 
306.077:>>Person2>>you're looking at the moon it's mostly flat right 
309.653:>>Person2>>you can't use a map without a compass 
309.695:>>Person3>>
312.448:>>Person1>>but the compass won't work without the magnetic field
317.515:>>Person1>>its a stellar map you can see the stars
317.545:>>Person3>>that 
321.483:>>Person3>>yeah relative to the stars you can figure out where you are 
321.863:>>Person1>>check it out if you're 
325.861:>>Person2>>so we're sure it's a map of the stars not 
325.929:>>Person3>>
327.168:>>Person1>>it's not the not the geographical map
327.278:>>Person2>>ok
330.367:>>Person3>>no no
333.237:>>Person1>> so we can make it fifteen
334.247:>>Person3>>yeah as it won't work 
339.014:>>Person3>>a few other things I think are important like terms of %HESITATION survival I don't know in what particular order but I think matches are probably important 
339.014:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
339.014:>>Person3>>I think I will actually I think the first aid is probably more important because matches in space you can't start a fire can you
351.361:>>Person1>> yeah
357.571:>>Person1>>any other use you have 
357.704:>>Person2>>well you'd have to use your oxygen
360.218:>>Person3>>yeah 
360.218:>>Person3>>but also what would be the purpose of starting fire 
361.4:>>Person2>>but also 
365.261:>>Person1>>but the portable heating if it is working we don't need the fire
365.271:>>Person3>>but 
369.396:>>Person3>>yeah that I also those very important because 
369.396:>>Person3>>you could freeze a lot of 
371.905:>>Person1>>we forgot about the communication the FM receiver transmitter
372.463:>>Person2>>
374.127:>>Person2>>yes so with really low 
376.654:>>Person2>>so I was really low about fire moon has very low atmosphere we are also going to get really cold really fast as like that Matt Damon movie uhh he put the little radiator there so
376.654:>>Person2>>not that the matches aren't useful they probably are not a src of heat 
384.232:>>Person3>>yeah 
384.232:>>Person3>>that might be in that 
393.383:>>Person3>>the heating is probably more useful 
393.459:>>Person2>> yeah
396.325:>>Person3>>so do you think that should be five 
399.338:>>Person2>> I think it's up there
399.794:>>Person1>>ok 
406.435:>>Person2>>then you wanted to go back to the FM transmitter
409.813:>>Person2>> you said its important
410.959:>>Person3>>yeah I think that I don't know what I 
410.959:>>Person3>>I think 
410.959:>>Person3>>something that it is also more as a first aid kit 
417.416:>>Person3>>that kind of ties in with basic survival like if you get sick it's like you're not going to make 
417.549:>>Person1>> yeah
423.822:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
426.038:>>Person1>>other items are for like camping I guess 
430.442:>>Person1>>parachute silk and rope
432.461:>>Person3>>yeah I thought the parachute silk and rope
432.461:>>Person3>>that might be helpful 
432.461:>>Person3>>I'm not sure exactly how I thought silly I would be very not useful would probably be the the pistols because 
432.461:>>Person3>>like who but what are you gonna do with it 
446.181:>>Person2>>I don't think you can fire without oxygen 
449.784:>>Person2>>  gun powder 
450.427:>>Person3>> what do you mean
453.929:>>Person2>>I dont think gun powder can work without oxygen 
456.342:>>Person3>> well regardless I mean in space who you are you gonna shoot 
456.342:>>Person3>>but it's not like there's like immediate threat you know 
456.669:>>Person1>>
463.518:>>Person3>>I think that was that and then like the like I said that like or are often mentioned before but the flares who's gonna see you like in space no one's looking for fire like oh look there is fire on the moon 
463.518:>>Person3>>no idea  
465.046:>>Person1>> yeah but if you are close to the mother ship
469.231:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
474.346:>>Person1>>if the receiver is not working 
474.346:>>Person1>>you can use it for communication if someone is there on the mother ship 
474.346:>>Person1>>you see 
486.058:>>Person3>>okay can you see from two hundred miles away 
489.261:>>Person1>>no but if you like very close and yet out of oxygen and 
489.345:>>Person3>>but as you get closer but it does 
493.048:>>Person3>>okay 
496.152:>>Person3>>okay that's going 
496.745:>>Person1>>yeah like the last resort
498.552:>>Person3>> okay
502.754:>>Person3>>so what's 
503.509:>>Person1>>so should we put communication first
504.846:>>Person3>>yeah so what 
508.848:>>Person3>>I think then I think actually probably be the FM receiver transmitter I think that's a fairly worth
508.848:>>Person3>>like to communicate with the mother ship I feel like if you're trying to get in contact and try to get back your way you'd be better off trying to use that transmitter before you use the flare to get someone's attention 
508.848:>>Person3>>%HESITATION they should not 
514.842:>>Person1>>yeah I feel you try 
522.42:>>Person1>>yeah 
522.42:>>Person1>>and they should know someone is coming
522.42:>>Person1>>at least they have some hope that someone's survived yeah 
522.42:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
522.42:>>Person1>>so you 
532.799:>>Person3>>yeah 
532.799:>>Person3>>so should that be six 
536.362:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
537.706:>>Person3>>any other remember that 
537.706:>>Person3>>live 
537.902:>>Person2>>remember that we crash landed so we should tend to injuries get as 
544.343:>>Person2>>healthy as possible to get moving
544.379:>>Person3>>yeah okay so first aid kit and then the transmitter so six seven 
548.586:>>Person2>>yeah 
549.699:>>Person1>>six seven
551.318:>>Person3>>okay 
557.74:>>Person2>>that leaves 
558.773:>>Person3>>we could start kind of working backwards like we put the compass on fifteen like I think maybe the milk 
558.773:>>Person3>>could be fourteen 
558.773:>>Person3>>right yeah yeah 
565.565:>>Person2>>sure yeah 
567.718:>>Person1>>box of matches 
572.375:>>Person3>>matches probably more useful than milk
572.375:>>Person3>>yeah 
572.376:>>Person1>>hello 
572.376:>>Person1>>yeah 
577.074:>>Person3>>so milk is fourteen matches a thirteen 
580.975:>>Person3>>or we want us any matches thirteen I guess but the milk was probably fourteen 
580.975:>>Person3>>on 
580.975:>>Person3>>says the compass spring 
589.102:>>Person2>>of 
592.041:>>Person2>>matches are still srcs of
594.665:>>Person2>>energy he if you really need it verses the pistol unless you take apart  the pistol
597.14:>>Person3>>yeah 
601.852:>>Person3>>yeah 
602.511:>>Person2>>that would be annoying that I don't think that's something we need to 
603.365:>>Person1>>and not just for match
609.773:>>Person1>> match can just ignite something. it is not a src of energy src of energy will be oxygen as a fuel
613.634:>>Person3>>yeah 
614.418:>>Person2>>%HESITATION has those little potassium it's a chemical 
616.811:>>Person3>>I also the priority for well the oxygen it 
620.422:>>Person3>>probably wiser to use it for breathing you know and you have the heating unit on 
626.209:>>Person3>>you know 
628.944:>>Person3>>umm
630.541:>>Person2>>so we were ranking between pistols and matches 
631.272:>>Person3>>right 
636.069:>>Person1>>also if we have the signal flares we can use it as matches
639.36:>>Person3>>yeah I think the matches are probably relatively unimportant 
639.36:>>Person3>>maybe thirteen both 
644.756:>>Person2>>alright
646.936:>>Person3>>we have one two three four we have five last 
651.132:>>Person3>>so we have the nylon rope parachute silk pistols life raft and signal flares 
662.732:>>Person1>>ok we can make pistol as twelve
662.732:>>Person3>>I agree the pistols are probably least helpful
668.291:>>Person3>>unless now you're in danger because of the animals or other people I guess that you have fight off 
675.269:>>Person3>>also I was thinking the life raft is probably relatively 
679.072:>>Person3>>unimportant 
681.232:>>Person2>>I 
682.335:>>Person1>>that's for if you want to take a break or something
686.722:>>Person3>>yeah 
687.67:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
688.322:>>Person3>>what are you gonna be in like water 
688.579:>>Person1>> there is no water on moon
691.392:>>Person2>>umm not in water 
691.887:>>Person3>>well yes then why do you need a life raft 
694.272:>>Person2>>life raft anything of the like secondary uses its cover 
699.919:>>Person2>>from %HESITATION 
702.033:>>Person2>>shelter at night at least 
703.765:>>Person3>>from the elements and space 
704.735:>>Person2>>yeah the solar 
707.864:>>Person2>>solar radiation you'd actually good  you could get cancer
711.28:>>Person3>>we have a lot 
711.597:>>Person1>>we have the suit already
713.225:>>Person3>>it's also probably going to go that rays are probably going to go through the life raft don't think that would be like a 
714.208:>>Person2>>dont know
719.063:>>Person2>>we're not sure if yours suits there 
720.365:>>Person1>>yeah 
720.365:>>Person1>>yeah 
720.365:>>Person1>>if we have the suits damaged you can use the silk
730.258:>>Person2>>so we are having the silk there
730.309:>>Person3>>yes I think so because probably next important so that could be eight 
731.554:>>Person1>> yeah
734.339:>>Person2>>okay 
738.544:>>Person3>>then I was also thinking the okay wait so we have left 
738.544:>>Person3>>the nylon rope the life raft and the signal flares 
746.299:>>Person3>>so 
747.607:>>Person3>>I think the flares are probably the next most important
754.633:>>Person3>>right like that someone needs communication like you are getting close 
757.669:>>Person1>>yeah 
761.542:>>Person1>>how can we use the rope 
764.392:>>Person1>>
764.62:>>Person3>>the rope I 
764.62:>>Person3>>in my eyes because I guess you don't really know the terrain you are going over like let's say you're climbing it's like rock and hills you might like me to make something of a rope to like you know I hope you get down here tied to something since we are not sure if it is a flat surface
764.62:>>Person3>>service I think I think out of all this the life raft is probably out of these three a life raft is probably the least important and I would probably be between the ropes and the flares for a really 
766.741:>>Person1>> how will you inflate the raft
769.694:>>Person1>> you would need oxygen
792.629:>>Person3>>yeah rather than using the oxygen you can be using your lungs and then you need more oxygen %HESITATION 
792.629:>>Person3>>and like you know it probably won't really do much against radiation from the sun 
802.192:>>Person2>>it still cover though you're gonna get 
805.889:>>Person2>>so really cold on the moon it's still cover like a blanket
809.596:>>Person3>>but we also do have a portable heating unit 
812.545:>>Person2>>uhh I mean
815.004:>>Person2>>so 
816.791:>>Person2>>and depends on how long the battery in it lasts I mean you want to insulate yourself
819.175:>>Person3>>
821.183:>>Person3>>that's true but I feel like if you if you get to the point they 
821.269:>>Person2>>because like heat is just escaping all the time 
824.319:>>Person1>>it is very good at it and say 
826.969:>>Person1>>and 
827.006:>>Person3>>
829.377:>>Person3>>and I feel like if you're if it gets to a point where the battery does die the portable heat heating unit then you probably have bigger problems if it's that long of a time span where the battery died your priority probably isn't warmth its probably you know you're probably starving at that point probably 
829.377:>>Person3>>where 
839.0:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
844.821:>>Person2>>I mean yeah we are balancing out all the necessary resrcs for a week but like 
845.102:>>Person3>>yeah all 
851.716:>>Person2>>expanding expanding them out of heating you can use as little as heating as possible to save the battery have insulation it is an important factor 
862.571:>>Person2>>heating escaping 
862.571:>>Person2>>right into the atmosphere right away 
868.436:>>Person3>>maybe 
875.085:>>Person3>>I think maybe the
875.085:>>Person3>>the signal flares would be next most 
882.14:>>Person3>>I don't know 
885.511:>>Person1>> or the rope I guess
886.291:>>Person3>>yeah like I said I'm I'm I feel like a life raft would be the least important out of 
887.13:>>Person1>> you need rope
891.478:>>Person3>>yeah because your dont know the terrain so maybe the rope is the next most important
