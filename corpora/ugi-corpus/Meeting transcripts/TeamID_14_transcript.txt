2.19:>>Person3>>So I guess we should start with what's the most important. 
6.89:>>Person2>>Probably oxygen?
8.8:>>Person3>>Yeah, yeah. Kind of expected that to happen.
8.85:>>Person4>>Oxygen.
8.88:>>Person1>>Oxygen.
9.83:>>Person4>>Great.
15.29:>>Person3>>Second.
16.88:>>Person1>>I put water.
17.55:>>Person4>>Water.
18.02:>>Person3>>I had heating, but honestly it's between those two. I have no particular favor for one over the other. I was only thinking- I think it's what two hundred miles, average five miles an hour, it's gonna be a few days. So there's going to be- I don't know, yeah I don't really have a favorite either.
18.05:>>Person2>>Yeah- water.
23.16:>>Person1>>Hmm.
43.24:>>Person2>>I feel like you can probably survive longer without heat than without water.
47.58:>>Person1>>And your body also produces body heat by walking, so, I-
50.12:>>Person4>>And if you're in a group, I think it'll provide more heat, but you still need water.
56.26:>>Person3>>That's fair, yeah.
58.56:>>Person4>>Water?
59.17:>>Person3>>I'm okay with that one.
60.23:>>Person4>>Alright.
64.05:>>Person3>>%HESITATION Then the third most important. Food?
67.03:>>Person1>>Food?
67.74:>>Person4>>I said food.
68.42:>>Person2>>Yeah, food.
72.22:>>Person3>>%HESITATION My only thought is that you have, you've got three days without food I think is the limit?
79.79:>>Person2>>I thought it was three weeks.
80.34:>>Person1>>Three weeks, yeah. 
81.3:>>Person3>>That one. Three days without water, three weeks without food, that was it. So I was thinking three days- three weeks without food is the limit, and for a two hundred mile journey it's probably not gonna take three weeks. %HESITATION I'm still saying heat on the moon is rather important and hard to come by. %HESITATION 
83.69:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
91.89:>>Person1>>True.
98.72:>>Person1>>True.
100.45:>>Person1>>Yeah I did a calculation at the beginning, it would take about forty hours of walking time to walk two hundred miles.
106.0:>>Person3>>Yeah I got something about that. 
108.25:>>Person2>>We'll probably burn a lot of calories on the moon, though, doing all that walking.
110.9:>>Person1>>True.
112.53:>>Person3>>Well, I mean-
113.63:>>Person3>>But it's less weight. Gravity's less, so-
117.94:>>Person1>>You can maintain your momentum much longer as well.
120.1:>>Person3>>Yeah exactly, so you're probably gonna- It's gonna be easier than walking on earth plus you can probably just hop, so- 
121.38:>>Person2>>Oh.
128.39:>>Person1>>We also don't know how hungry they are when they land, so that's, that's good to know.
131.14:>>Person3>>Yeah, that's true, that's true. I would still say that heating is a bit more important, moon's atmosphere is not really a thing, so warmth would be difficult to come by.
143.86:>>Person4>>So heat for the third option?
145.29:>>Person2>>Yeah, let's put heat.
149.84:>>Person3>>Then fourth-
150.37:>>Person4>>Mhm.
150.9:>>Person1>>Wait so that's portable heating unit? Okay. Okay. 
152.36:>>Person3>>Port- yeah, portable heating unit, yeah.
157.47:>>Person3>>And then fourth I had food there.
160.32:>>Person1>>Yup.
160.97:>>Person2>>Fourth I had heating.
164.37:>>Person4>>Sounds good.
165.0:>>Person3>>Yeah, I mean-
172.55:>>Person1>>I mean here's where it gets tricky. I think I put- I put solar powered FM receiver for five.
173.84:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
178.24:>>Person3>>Same.
178.51:>>Person4>>Yeah.
178.79:>>Person2>>I put first aid. I mean it's not likely that there's an emergency but there's such a big risk.
185.21:>>Person3>>Yeah.
188.48:>>Person3>>My only question on that was I don't know what's in the first aid. Like it just says first day containing injection needles.
192.5:>>Person4>>Aside from injections.
192.68:>>Person2>>Yeah.
195.02:>>Person2>>Yeah, what are we injecting? 
196.46:>>Person3>>And is that all that there, because-
200.28:>>Person3>>I mean the big question is are we in suits? Or are we just dead on arrival?
202.88:>>Person1>>Yeah, that's a good question.
205.45:>>Person3>>%HESITATION
208.1:>>Person4>>(Laughter)
208.41:>>Person3>>I just really really don't know. Are we- I don't even know technically if we're actually human. I don't think we have mother ships yet, so that's still actually a question in my mind here, but- Yeah, I'm not against first aid, but my only thing I have no idea what's in that box.
214.24:>>Person1>>(Laughter)
215.25:>>Person2>>so actually a question where white 
222.97:>>Person2>>Yeah we might want to put that a little lower because we don't know what it's-
227.23:>>Person3>>Yeah that's the thing- it's important to have in case something goes wrong, but if we're in a suit, I don't know how much a first aid kit will help, because if you've been injured the suit's probably been damaged too.
232.2:>>Person1>>Mhm.
239.92:>>Person1>>True.
240.94:>>Person2>>True.
241.95:>>Person3>>So-
242.58:>>Person4>>I was also thinking that %HESITATION, the receiver transmitter was more- a little more important because you're trying to get contact with the mother ship, let them know that A, we've crashed, B, we're on our way.
253.75:>>Person3>>Yeah.
254.0:>>Person1>>True, well I was thinking about that though, is, it states on the sheet like it's a requirement you must travel 200 miles, so I'm not sure- they can give you directions I guess, but- 
262.68:>>Person3>>They can give you directions, they can-
265.4:>>Person4>>Wait for you. 
266.17:>>Person3>>Yeah, yeah I guess- I guess that's also true they could wait, they- you could be, yeah we're not dead in the crash were on our way. We are so far out and so-
273.46:>>Person1>>True, but it's not like they can-
274.78:>>Person4>>Maybe they could help send supplies or something.
276.43:>>Person1>>Oh, yeah, true.
277.3:>>Person3>>Yeah, that's the thing I don't know if they can, but that's kind of what I was thinking, if they could direct you or even send out supplies if they have something.
285.83:>>Person4>>Like as long as we're in contact with them, I think that's important.
288.24:>>Person3>>Yeah.
289.72:>>Person2>>Yeah we- I actually agree with that.
293.92:>>Person3>>So we'll put that for five then.
294.92:>>Person2>>Mhm.
296.35:>>Person3>>That works.
300.68:>>Person3>>%HESITATION what did- For the sixth most important. %HESITATION
306.34:>>Person1>>I would have to say first aid.
309.36:>>Person3>>Yeah, that sounds good.
309.47:>>Person2>>Yeah I put the compass but I'm willing to put the first aid six since I ranked it high.
309.47:>>Person4>>First aid?
314.35:>>Person3>>Yeah, yeah. That's the thing, is aside from the- is it just needles? Assuming it's not that, then first aid would definitely be important. You can probably patch a space suit with a bandage, maybe.
330.63:>>Person4>>Would the next one be the magnetic compass?
333.5:>>Person1>>Let's see.
333.96:>>Person2>>Yeah, probably.
335.83:>>Person3>>Okay, like, I legitimately forget how strong the moon's magnetic field is.
340.18:>>Person3>>Does anybody here know that off the top of their head? (Laughter)
340.22:>>Person2>>Yeah. I'm- I'm in ECSE so I should know.
340.26:>>Person1>>No.
341.29:>>Person4>>I don't know. 
344.94:>>Person3>>I-
345.44:>>Person1>>Me too. I have no clue.
345.48:>>Person2>>But I don't, because I got a C in physics 2.
347.77:>>Person3>>%HESITATION
349.51:>>Person3>>Oh but physics two is awful.
353.8:>>Person4>>The task at hand, though.
355.25:>>Person3>>Oh yeah back to this. %HESITATION Yeah, some form of navigation would be useful but %HESITATION
362.09:>>Person4>>I don't know how strong the magnetic field is.
364.0:>>Person1>>Do you even know like which direction the mother ship is in? Do you know if it's north or-
367.83:>>Person3>>That's kind of what- I was com- That's the thing I don't know what- if we have any idea-
373.68:>>Person1>>Yeah we don't have much information on what information we have.
376.35:>>Person3>>The ship was force to land spot some- so if you know how far, you have to at least have an idea of a direction.
383.46:>>Person3>>Like the- you would- like the idea is we were traveling there, we crashed two hundred miles away. We probably some idea where we're going, at least direction wise.
383.7:>>Person1>>True.
391.69:>>Person1>>Hmm.
395.21:>>Person1>>Actually now that I think about it, I think direction is probably the most important, like I'm thinking it should be probably be one. Or, not in front of oxygen, but-
405.73:>>Person3>>Yeah I would definitely keep some of the survival stuff at one. %HESITATION Water, oxygen are definitely like one and two.  
414.65:>>Person1>>Mhm.
416.25:>>Person3>>Though for yeah no I don't know if I just read- I think navigation might be more important than we have it.
426.19:>>Person1>>Yeah. There's no point to surviving if you have no clue where you're going.
431.8:>>Person3>>So should we move that up somewhere?
435.11:>>Person4>>Should we um, like substitute that for portable heating, and then like switch it, so portable heating becomes the fourth one, and move everything down?
444.91:>>Person3>>Yeah, I like that idea. For a- wait were we doing this for the- so that's the question, for navigation we really have the map or the compass.
447.01:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
454.21:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
454.26:>>Person1>>Hmm.
455.75:>>Person4>>I think those two go hand in hand.
457.73:>>Person3>>That- yeah, so. 
460.37:>>Person3>>I feel like you can probably get by with one of them, I would say the map would be better 
466.38:>>Person1>>Hmm.
467.42:>>Person3>>Mostly again because I know that map of the stars to be useful. I don't remember how consistent or strong the moon's magnetic field is.
475.15:>>Person1>>True. 
475.73:>>Person2>>True.
476.48:>>Person3>>%HESITATION Like the stars are- if the stars are mapped the stars are consistent enough to navigate by.
483.88:>>Person4>>So should we say the stellar map is third, then?
488.64:>>Person3>>Yeah, I like that idea. 
490.14:>>Person4>>Is that okay with everyone?
492.53:>>Person2>>I guess.
493.01:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
494.58:>>Person3>>I mean if you don't agree, we can always keep talking.
496.88:>>Person4>>Yeah, we can-
498.13:>>Person1>>Just one thing. I don't think- Wouldn't you freeze before you get to your destination? Like isn't heating on par with water and air? 
498.89:>>Person3>>Yeah, sure. 
509.92:>>Person3>>Yeah.
510.85:>>Person4>>So do you wanna put it at four?
512.8:>>Person1>>Yeah that's what I was thinking.
512.98:>>Person3>>Four? Because there is no way you starve before getting there. 
517.13:>>Person1>>Yeah, that's what I was thinking. So, instead of food.
520.45:>>Person3>>So we put the map at uh, four, and then move everything else down.
526.57:>>Person2>>Mhm.
527.94:>>Person4>>So then food becomes five, the transmitter becomes six, first aid kit becomes seven.
535.8:>>Person3>>Yeah.
536.96:>>Person1>>And then I guess the compass?
538.92:>>Person4>>Yeah.
539.83:>>Person3>>Yeah.
539.99:>>Person2>>Sure.
540.23:>>Person3>>Compass at eight? That's a good idea.
546.34:>>Person3>>Uh for nine- yeah now we're just gonna get into guesses and maybes.
550.28:>>Person1>>(Laughter)
551.86:>>Person3>>Um.
553.69:>>Person4>>What's your number seven?
556.65:>>Person3>>Uh mine was the map.
556.91:>>Person2>>Mine was the map.
558.98:>>Person3>>The highest one I have left, is I have signal players at six. If you do get trapped somewhere.
566.08:>>Person2>>I had them at eight, that's my highest left.
568.84:>>Person3>>That's the- they go pretty high, you are on the moon. So.
575.53:>>Person4>>I had the fifty feet nylon rope at seven and the signal flares at eight.
580.86:>>Person3>>Yeah I mean I think nylon was my next one yeah.
584.4:>>Person2>>I put nylon down at eleven because I have no clue how you would use it but you guys are probably more right than I am.
591.48:>>Person3>>Well that's not necessarily true, but rope's just a useful thing to have around.
597.12:>>Person4>>Especially if you're traveling in groups, like to keep each other together, or help, I don't know.
598.99:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
602.64:>>Person1>>This sounds stupid-
603.15:>>Person2>>I used to use it as- my days as a camp counselor to get pre-school children to line up because they couldn't understand lining up.
610.06:>>Person3>>You were gonna say though?
612.84:>>Person1>>I had life rafts, cause it could serve as a bed. 
616.43:>>Person3>>I actually had not life raft but I had uh parachute rather high. For similar like- It's just like tarp that's really useful to have around. A life raft is kinda the same deal- idea, plus bed.
630.07:>>Person1>>Yeah.
630.5:>>Person3>>But, no yeah.
632.1:>>Person1>>Hmm, this is gonna be hard to do.
634.05:>>Person3>>Yeah but I I personally think. I I personally think either flares or the rope would be the next most important.
644.76:>>Person4>>If we're building a bed-like contraption, we could combine items, so like the rope, the parachute, and the um life raft. You know, to get some shelter.
655.14:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
657.23:>>Person1>>I see, okay.
659.25:>>Person3>>We're gonna categorize everything I put those boats under like travel. Those are just useful for getting around anything.
666.46:>>Person3>>So. 
669.35:>>Person1>>Well-
669.49:>>Person2>>If we could put like the portable heating unit inside a makeshift shelter.
672.57:>>Person3>>Yeah exactly and you can drag it along with the rope.
677.17:>>Person3>>Holding, yeah.
679.23:>>Person1>>Well, there's no precipitation on th emoon I don't think so the tarp-
685.68:>>Person2>>The tarp will help keep the heat like trapped inside an area.
688.19:>>Person3>>Well yeah it could hold the heat and then on top of that a tarp is honestly just useful for carrying things. Back to the if someone gets injured you can use a tarp to make a gurney- that's not the word. Stretcher.  I mean that was my thinking for it, not to keep things war- dry, but it's like useful for carrying. So it's like a bag.
703.79:>>Person1>>Okay.
715.53:>>Person1>>One final question.  
716.63:>>Person3>>Sure or maybe more questions. (Laughter)
718.43:>>Person1>>Many more maybe, so portable heating unit, we're in space, and I think heating only works with a medium.
726.09:>>Person3>>Not really no you'd have-
726.43:>>Person1>>Right?
727.94:>>Person1>>Are you sure?
729.3:>>Person2>>We can assume the medium for the heating unit's intact with the heating unit.
733.9:>>Person3>>Well it'd be- It would be less effective but I mean think of the sun heats the Earth. There is-
738.34:>>Person3>>There well it isn't- there'd be radiation there'd be heat radiation. I wouldn't travel as far or be quite as effective but I believe it would still kind of work.
739.82:>>Person1>>Yeah, that's light, there's electromagnetic.
751.9:>>Person1>>Okay.
752.8:>>Person3>>You would end up having to like, huddle around it kinda deal.
757.17:>>Person1>>Okay, I'll trust you.
759.44:>>Person4>>Does anyone know how we're doing on time?
759.96:>>Person1>>(Laughter)
762.62:>>Person3>>I don't think it really matters.
765.33:>>Person2>>So what are we going to put ninth?
767.86:>>Person3>>Ninth? Oh yea, I would say rope, but.
768.92:>>Person4>>Yeah, we're up to nine.
772.82:>>Person4>>That was next on my list, rope.
775.19:>>Person3>>Rope for nine then?
777.0:>>Person2>>Sure.
777.98:>>Person4>>How do you feel?
778.08:>>Person3>>You have another idea?
778.58:>>Person1>>I would- I would say raft.
780.16:>>Person3>>Raft?
781.54:>>Person1>>Yeah, because what are you gonna pull with a rope if you don't have anything with a higher priority?
787.25:>>Person4>>Each other.
788.18:>>Person3>>Yea well that's the- you would tie each other together the other so no one gets lost.
791.28:>>Person1>>Oh, okay, cool.
791.97:>>Person3>>Yeah.
793.81:>>Person3>>So nine for rope?
794.34:>>Person4>>And then ten life raft?
794.63:>>Person1>>Yeah.
798.48:>>Person2>>Sure.
799.32:>>Person1>>Yeah.
799.47:>>Person3>>I like that, yeah.
803.2:>>Person1>>And then, parachute, eleven.
804.76:>>Person3>>I'd say signal flare eleven.
806.38:>>Person1>>Okay.
806.56:>>Person2>>Yeah, definitely. 
806.97:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
807.27:>>Person3>>And then parachute twelve.
809.42:>>Person1>>Okay.
809.46:>>Person3>>I think the single flare- but again, just kind of the same idea as the receiver %HESITATION if help is needed you can shoot a signal flare up and it will be up there for awhile.
818.82:>>Person1>>Okay.
821.06:>>Person2>>So thirteen, probably box of matches because that's probably more useful than dehydrated milk or a gun.
828.14:>>Person1>>Mhm.
828.32:>>Person3>>Yeah.
828.68:>>Person4>>There's also the oxygen.
829.53:>>Person3>>Well the milk, the milk's actually not super useful either.
833.48:>>Person4>>Does anyone know the rate of oxygen up on the moon?
837.88:>>Person1>>The oxygen depletion?
838.64:>>Person4>>Yeah.
840.68:>>Person3>>You mean like-
841.64:>>Person4>>Because fire needs oxygen.
844.08:>>Person3>>Yeah no but signal flares are what, phos-
846.23:>>Person4>>No, I'm talking about the matches.
848.34:>>Person3>>Oh. Yeah I kind of ranked the matches, the gun, and the milk around the same of kinda useless. I don't really have a preferred order for those. I would almost say the milk is more important because it is still protein.
848.51:>>Person4>>For the matches.
864.15:>>Person1>>Yeah, it's consumable. 
867.79:>>Person2>>Yeah, now that I think about it, like I thought matches would be useful if you're surviving, but implying there's oxygen, and we wouldn't be breathing the oxygen.
868.4:>>Person3>>Yeah.
873.66:>>Person3>>Yeah.
877.38:>>Person3>>Yeah, no, I think-
877.64:>>Person1>>Can't burn our entire oxygen supply.
880.97:>>Person3>>I would honestly say for the last three just milk, matches, guns.
886.28:>>Person1>>Yup, I agree.
886.69:>>Person2>>Sure.
887.23:>>Person3>>I would only put the guns lowest, because you're not gonna shoot somebody with a match by accident.
892.12:>>Person4>>Yeah I don't-
892.43:>>Person1>>Unless there's aliens on the moon.
893.94:>>Person4>>I don't think we're gonna battle anyone at the moon.
897.15:>>Person1>>Mhm.
897.21:>>Person3>>No.
897.37:>>Person4>>%HESITATION The milk is probably more useful than the box of matches, I don't know if we can.
