1.281:>>Person1>>%HESITATION okay 
4.28:>>Person1>>so what did you guys have for number one 
7.679:>>Person3>>mine case is the oxygen tank
9.436:>>Person2>>yeah same here same with me
11.64:>>Person1>>okay %HESITATION I had five gallons of water %HESITATION
16.997:>>Person2>>yeah I think it was either going to be water or oxygen for the for one and two
23.784:>>Person2>>but yeah %HESITATION don't know why I ended up going for oxygen
28.981:>>Person3>>I was thinking of %HESITATION the most essential thing you need
29.401:>>Person2>>but 
30.939:>>Person2>>yeah 
32.474:>>Person1>>okay yeah if you want to get out of the tank you gotta yeah I can see that 
33.33:>>Person3>>when we're out there
33.572:>>Person2>>yeah to survive
37.116:>>Person2>>yeah 
39.025:>>Person2>>so like also based on like sparse atmosphere of the moon stuff like that so like do we go for 
45.855:>>Person2>>oxygen for one okay
48.086:>>Person1>>yup
52.565:>>Person2>>okay
55.81:>>Person1>>okay yeah so number two I had food
61.237:>>Person2>>hm
62.155:>>Person1>>but I did have water as number one
64.063:>>Person2>>yeah I think I have water for number two
66.365:>>Person3>>I put food actually
69.768:>>Person3>>further down the road because it's two hundred miles and
69.802:>>Person1>>oh really 
70.04:>>Person2>>yeah 
72.903:>>Person2>>yeah 
74.256:>>Person3>>I think we have more important things here to take rather than food itself
79.239:>>Person3>>'cause human body can survive without food a long longer period of time if you want to go there is that we need some communication but other than that to to me 
87.017:>>Person2>>mhm
88.809:>>Person3>>so %HESITATION 
88.825:>>Person2>>yeah 
90.857:>>Person1>>so what did you have as your number two
92.947:>>Person3>>so my number two was actually %HESITATION transmitter I don't know but now I think with two hundred mile I was not getting that what it is I think an essential
93.147:>>Person2>>hm
95.946:>>Person2>>I had I had haha yeah I had water for number two so yeah do we go yeah we go with yeah so we go with water for two
96.193:>>Person1>>transmitter okay 
104.769:>>Person1>>yeah I agree with water for number two
105.024:>>Person3>>what is your water okay yeah I think yeah I made a mistake in that sense
114.423:>>Person2>>alright
116.916:>>Person2>>I put food at number three like the food concentrate 
120.193:>>Person3>>okay
120.809:>>Person1>>okay yeah I had mine as milk I was just thinking of water and food like the food and the milk as my top 
128.247:>>Person2>>yeah I think water is like
131.481:>>Person2>>more of a necessity because it's like dehydrated milk so you probably it's like probably some kind of powder or something yeah yeah yeah and
132.817:>>Person3>>
137.58:>>Person3>>yeah it's another form of food so
143.193:>>Person2>>this is as food concentrate
143.29:>>Person1>>so you had three as food concentrate okay
147.185:>>Person2>>yeah yeah
148.923:>>Person1>>what about you
150.349:>>Person3>>%HESITATION I think I focus more on the communication like I mean like the 
152.211:>>Person2>>yeah okay
152.213:>>Person1>>okay gotcha alright
155.961:>>Person3>>instruments so my three was compass
156.623:>>Person1>>so let's see 
159.274:>>Person2>>okay okay 
160.486:>>Person1>>yeah I put those as lower 
162.227:>>Person2>>yeah mine are not that low but yeah I mean somewhere down the middle so yeah so this is going to be 
170.689:>>Person3>>we want to put three as food
171.497:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
172.842:>>Person1>>%HESITATION yeah I think that's a good choice 
174.728:>>Person2>>yeah I think we can 
176.902:>>Person3>>okay
177.276:>>Person2>>put three as food right like the food concentrate
179.122:>>Person3>>mhm
181.024:>>Person1>>yeah 
184.848:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
185.018:>>Person2>>alright
187.1:>>Person1>>four I had the that now I had the tank 
190.619:>>Person3>>okay 
191.945:>>Person2>>hm
192.435:>>Person1>>%HESITATION so we already put that one 
194.873:>>Person2>>yeah I had my four as the portable heating unit 
195.005:>>Person3>>so
198.398:>>Person3>>okay 
198.962:>>Person2>>because %HESITATION
200.46:>>Person2>>we need to stay warm probably I mean I don't know about the temperature on the moon 
203.552:>>Person3>>mhm
206.447:>>Person2>>but yeah 
207.642:>>Person3>>so I wasn't sure of the device of this heating unit 
210.508:>>Person2>>yeah 
211.344:>>Person3>>if you want to move as a group I don't know 
214.672:>>Person3>>only one you need how can that help 
214.942:>>Person2>>yeah yeah it just says portable heating unit
217.629:>>Person1>>I have
219.501:>>Person1>>I put okay so like my four was taken but like my number five was %HESITATION the solar powered receiver
225.782:>>Person3>>I think the transmitter is one of the most important part 
229.314:>>Person2>>%HESITATION yeah because 
229.41:>>Person1>>yeah because after yeah after after you have like food like you need to tell people that you're like lost
231.082:>>Person2>>yeah I had 
233.739:>>Person2>>right I I had that as five so yeah so we can go for that as yeah that's a good that's a good choice for four probably 
236.265:>>Person3>>mhm
236.41:>>Person1>>okay I have that as five 
238.358:>>Person3>>I think that's the next important thing we need
244.048:>>Person2>>okay
246.942:>>Person2>>hm
248.266:>>Person2>>alright 
250.253:>>Person3>>now once you have the transmitter to communicate now if you want to navigate to the mother ship I think two important thing is %HESITATION the stellar map and the compass 
252.759:>>Person2>>yeah 
255.683:>>Person2>>mhm compass compass and the yeah
260.071:>>Person1>>yeah compass and the map
261.74:>>Person2>>yeah so do we go for like which one is probably more important
261.74:>>Person2>>yeah yeah yeah I had yeah I had compass and map as seven and eight so around the same place so it's okay
264.514:>>Person1>>I think probably the compass
264.961:>>Person3>>compass is more important
267.677:>>Person1>>compass and then the map 
271.219:>>Person3>>okay
273.565:>>Person3>>can we move it up to five and six
273.609:>>Person2>>so five and six five and six yeah 
275.327:>>Person1>>yeah yeah 
279.253:>>Person2>>okay okay so the next is seven 
281.404:>>Person1>>and after that 
281.404:>>Person1>>I had then I had the 
286.142:>>Person1>>heating unit 
287.31:>>Person3>>okay
289.568:>>Person2>>yeah 
292.202:>>Person2>>hm mhm
292.283:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I don't know if guys agree with that
294.578:>>Person2>>yeah I think 
296.521:>>Person1>>so we have a way to try and get there but then if you're like 
303.319:>>Person1>>if like you're trying to like not be colder or
306.23:>>Person2>>hm I also had the first aid kit around this range because the because the thing is that you've like there has been some kind of an accident and you need people to be on you on their feet yeah yeah yeah 
310.085:>>Person3>>yeah 
314.541:>>Person3>>yes
319.144:>>Person3>>because it is an unfamiliar territory you don't know what can happen so my first aid was number seven 
320.664:>>Person1>>okay 
323.833:>>Person2>>yeah my first aid was nine 
325.977:>>Person2>>so yeah
325.992:>>Person1>>okay 
327.09:>>Person3>>and I somehow put the heating unit still further down so maybe that 
327.18:>>Person2>>okay
330.051:>>Person2>>okay HESITATIONmy heating unit was very high up so 
331.492:>>Person1>>mhm so
335.314:>>Person3>>yeah so either first aid or %HESITATION heating unit as number seven
338.538:>>Person2>>yeah 
338.538:>>Person2>>so which one do we go for which one seems more important
341.094:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
343.476:>>Person1>>I guess 
347.258:>>Person1>>first aid kit 
350.399:>>Person3>>no one is thinking about the heating unit right now we would need it all the time 
351.63:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
352.635:>>Person2>>yeah 
354.847:>>Person2>>yeah because it's like unfamiliar territory yeah
360.598:>>Person3>>but it depends on some accident but that low probability
362.315:>>Person2>>yeah that's that's more of a 
365.265:>>Person1>>okay 
366.154:>>Person2>>probabilistic thing
367.461:>>Person3>>what do you think
368.668:>>Person1>>so seven as portable heating unit 
371.853:>>Person2>>hm
372.932:>>Person3>>okay and eight is the first aid okay
373.467:>>Person2>>yeah 
373.467:>>Person2>>probably seven and eight seven for the 
376.23:>>Person1>>oh seven portable heating unit was seven
379.091:>>Person2>>okay that's great then
379.091:>>Person2>>so portable heating at seven 
380.762:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
383.11:>>Person3>>and first aid as eight
383.458:>>Person2>>and first aid as eight
385.462:>>Person2>>okay good 
387.777:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
387.839:>>Person2>>alright then
389.819:>>Person1>>then I had okay wait %HESITATION 
389.914:>>Person2>>yeah 
392.824:>>Person3>>I'm not exactly sure what is life raft id but 
395.989:>>Person2>>I think those like big HESITATION 
398.846:>>Person3>>we can take shelter around
399.939:>>Person2>>no I think it's a raft that you flow downstream on it yeah yeah yeah so something made out of logs of wood or something 
402.46:>>Person3>>oh okay to move quickly
402.915:>>Person1>>yeah like a water 
402.915:>>Person1>>I put that 
409.092:>>Person1>>yeah 
409.38:>>Person2>>yeah 
410.476:>>Person1>>I mean I put that at the end just because I thought of a life raft as like something that would go on the like rivers and like I feel like on the moon it's just you don't really need it so like I put that at the end 
416.025:>>Person3>>we don't we may not find any yes
419.161:>>Person2>>yeah 
419.161:>>Person2>>yeah 
422.786:>>Person2>>yeah my lap life raft was at number eleven 
422.942:>>Person3>>okay
425.58:>>Person1>>asked how 
425.616:>>Person3>>okay
426.464:>>Person2>>yeah 
427.37:>>Person1>>%HESITATION but after the first aid kit 
430.663:>>Person2>>I mean yeah I mean after the first aid I think it's very difficult to kind of choose432.675:>>Person1>>yeah mine was twelve
433.188:>>Person3>>%HESITATION
434.555:>>Person3>>like all 
434.946:>>Person1>>%HESITATION but after the first aid kit
437.011:>>Person3>>I think another important part is signal flare if you want to yeah mine was five since it's another form of communication
437.252:>>Person2>>yeah yeah yeah
439.252:>>Person1>>that that's what I was saying added %HESITATION I had that as ten so that would be nine
443.308:>>Person2>>yeah my signal flares was at six yeah so yeah so that I think features pretty high up on our priority list so one two so that's that's gonna be nine yeah 
445.699:>>Person1>>mm and it was ten okay
451.924:>>Person3>>mhm
457.629:>>Person2>>alright
457.658:>>Person1>>do we go for the other src of food the milk
463.356:>>Person3>>milk is %HESITATION if we already have the food with us I think %HESITATION I mean yeah like what do you all think of the box of matches 
463.477:>>Person2>>yeah 
467.385:>>Person1>>but like if you run out like 
470.095:>>Person2>>hm
470.808:>>Person1>>I mean I I wouldn't want to put like some like a case of like food all the way at the end 
480.93:>>Person1>>I don't think that's
480.976:>>Person3>>is it essential
481.04:>>Person2>>box of matches I I initially had it at like fourteen yeah
483.631:>>Person1>>I had it as six
484.957:>>Person3>>to have some fire
485.007:>>Person1>>I had it as six 'cause at night you need warmth but even over that I think the milk is like important because if you're with a crew like and you don't have food and you don't have energy like you're gonna starve you know
502.003:>>Person3>>but it's two hundred miles long distance yeah it'll take some hours yeah I think it and it is not easy to move on the raft
503.849:>>Person1>>which is a long distance 
504.577:>>Person2>>so yeah
506.941:>>Person2>>this is difficult 
508.106:>>Person1>>that's a long like if your ship 
511.083:>>Person2>>yeah 
514.516:>>Person1>>so I think the milk should like 
514.661:>>Person2>>like it's
516.386:>>Person2>>yeah because I had the milk at %HESITATION ten
519.346:>>Person1>>yeah I had it as three so 
519.867:>>Person2>>okay
519.959:>>Person3>>okay put that at ten then
523.254:>>Person2>>yeah that's going to be ten probably yeah 
526.651:>>Person2>>and after that I'm not too sure
530.421:>>Person1>>%HESITATION yeah 
531.585:>>Person2>>maybe maybe maybe a box of matches 
Person3>>matches and rope I think rope I think may be an important thing
536.115:>>Person2>>
537.079:>>Person1>>I think matches 
538.964:>>Person2>>I mean let's we can go for the matches first 
543.122:>>Person3>>mhm
543.459:>>Person2>>and that can be eleven and %HESITATION rope and silk pretty much can I mean I mean yeah do the same thing
543.547:>>Person1>>mm yeah
546.657:>>Person3>>the last 
546.924:>>Person1>>yeah
549.13:>>Person3>>do the same thing 
549.403:>>Person1>>yeah yeah I put them on the last that I really didn't see any use for it like I I'd rather have the life raft as like some sort of shelter other than a piece of rope or sil or silk 
553.911:>>Person2>>
556.134:>>Person2>>
558.167:>>Person2>>right 
560.534:>>Person2>>
562.183:>>Person3>>%HESITATION in case of rope I think %HESITATION if you move as a group in a very dark place you need rope to be communicating directly connected with each other the way they move around to walk around people need to be connected to something like that the rope can be a useful thing when you are walking from place
565.178:>>Person2>>right 
567.669:>>Person2>>
572.177:>>Person1>>yeah 
575.913:>>Person2>>yeah yeah
578.824:>>Person2>>yeah we can we can probably go for the so what else do we have 
582.968:>>Person1>>I think the life raft should go as number twelve
584.6:>>Person3>>yeah life raft should
586.123:>>Person2>>life raft can yeah as you said it can act as a shelter so we can go for the life raft probably at twelve
586.352:>>Person3>>can connect to the that was my concern
587.113:>>Person1>>it's at least some sort of like shelter 
593.044:>>Person3>>twelve yes
594.663:>>Person3>>it was actually eight on mine so
596.607:>>Person2>>yeah life raft was eleven so it's okay
598.341:>>Person1>>yeah mine actually matched 
601.043:>>Person1>>%HESITATION thirteen 
601.606:>>Person2>>yeah and then 
603.476:>>Person1>>I have the gun rope okay
603.523:>>Person2>>yeah probably 
605.243:>>Person3>>I would go for rope
605.352:>>Person2>>rope yeah rope for thirteen 
609.606:>>Person2>>silk with 
611.76:>>Person3>>yeah mine pistol is the last one 
612.05:>>Person2>>yeah yes same with same with 
614.31:>>Person1>>yeah my gun was thirteen just in case there's like any weird creature which I doubt it honestly so I guess the silk would be fourteen
619.092:>>Person2>>yeah yeah silk fourteen and the gun would be
628.044:>>Person3>>yeah that was pretty easy
629.761:>>Person2>>yeah
