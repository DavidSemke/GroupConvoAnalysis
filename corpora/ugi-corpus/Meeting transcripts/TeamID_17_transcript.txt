2.01:>>Person3>>So I think we should probably figure out what our priorities are, first of all. I think priority number one is continuing to breathe. 
10.27:>>Person1>>Right, I agree. That's the one- that's the first one that I chose as well.
10.34:>>Person2>>Yeah, I also chose the oxygen.
14.46:>>Person3>>Cool, so we can agree on that.
17.0:>>Person2>>The second one I chose water. 
20.29:>>Person3>>%HESITATION as did I.
21.14:>>Person1>>Second one, the one that I chose was %HESITATION the stellar map because we don't- it doesn't say on the description exactly where we know the ship is, and- 
31.68:>>Person3>>On- on the other hand, we know we're about two hundred miles away. Well I mean probably as long as it's in the top five we'll probably be fine. %HESITATION 
44.69:>>Person1>>I mean, two hundred miles is a long distance especially on the moon, so it's it's right that we we need water.
46.56:>>Person3>>Oh yeah I think we're gonna die.
49.0:>>Person2>>Yeah, we need water and food.
50.63:>>Person3>>I'm I'm pretty sure we're all gonna die.
51.57:>>Person1>>(Laughter)
52.57:>>Person2>>I think to leave is the first thing, and then to find where the mother ship is. So I chose water and food as second and third.
54.3:>>Person3>>Like. 
64.2:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
66.43:>>Person1>>Okay.
67.05:>>Person3>>I think I think %HESITATION I did air, water, food, and then navigation equipment, communications equipment, and then what else? Shelter stuff, but, anyway, so.
84.98:>>Person1>>Yeah, I think I think my order was a little bit different. And so I had air and then I had navigation equipment and then I had food, but I think those two are sort of the kind I guess the difficult ones to decide.
88.34:>>Person1>>A little more than that, yeah.
92.92:>>Person3>>Yeah. Can we all agree the life raft is useless?
96.55:>>Person1>>Yes. 
97.88:>>Person3>>Cool. I put that fifteen. 
98.72:>>Person1>>I think some of the other things like the pistol and %HESITATION what else? Life raft and the flare as well, because I don't think you can use the flare.
103.62:>>Person2>>So the pistol is for the heating unit?
109.0:>>Person3>>Oh, no. Flares are self contained they burn %HESITATION like if you light if you light a distress flair and then toss it over the side of a boat it keeps burining under water.
111.47:>>Person1>>Okay?
112.99:>>Person1>>I mean, don't you need oxygen?
117.66:>>Person1>>But don't you need oxygen, too?
119.12:>>Person3>>Nope, they have fuel and oxidizer and then, they're really dangerous.
120.73:>>Person1>>Okay. Oh they have it, okay.
124.87:>>Person2>>Okay.
125.23:>>Person3>>But you know if you need it to never go out.
128.43:>>Person3>>And they're very they're very handy for signaling, particularly on somewhere like the moon where most things are going to be optically based.
132.81:>>Person1>>Right.
136.32:>>Person1>>Okay.
138.26:>>Person2>>So what should be the second one?
141.04:>>Person3>>I mean we're gonna die of dehydration in like probably less than sixty miles without water.
142.84:>>Person1>>Yeah I guess food would be-
148.93:>>Person1>>Okay.
150.24:>>Person2>>Okay, so water and food.
153.23:>>Person3>>Yeah and then I use the, I, I said the food concentrate because uh, for third, because.
158.74:>>Person1>>Yeah.
163.1:>>Person1>>So are we, are we ranking food as a second necessary item after oxygen, so in which case it would be-
168.1:>>Person3>>I-
168.76:>>Person2>>I chose water as the second one.  
170.52:>>Person1>>Second one, okay. Yeah and then concentrate and then-
171.49:>>Person3>>Yeah, because you you can you can live for about two weeks without food you can't live for more than a few days without water.
171.97:>>Person2>>Water is more important.
174.96:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
182.2:>>Person1>>Okay.
184.29:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
184.35:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
184.51:>>Person1>>What was the third one? I think we said food concentrate. Fourth one?
188.28:>>Person3>>What did I put for fourth? I put the compass fourth because like-
188.35:>>Person2>>Yeah.
192.68:>>Person2>>I put the map for, as fourth.
195.64:>>Person2>>Maybe someone has a sense of direction.
197.88:>>Person1>>What did you put?
199.18:>>Person2>>The stellar map.
201.35:>>Person1>>The map.
201.8:>>Person3>>Well, if if it was a terrain map that would be cool because like if if we have if we have a topographical map we can just go, oh that hill is there, and then guesstimate where we are, but if it's a a stellar map, we we do need actually we need a sextant.
201.89:>>Person2>>Yeah.
215.01:>>Person2>>So it won't know.
220.43:>>Person3>>%HESITATION But I don't know how handy a magnetic compass would be on the moon.
224.84:>>Person1>>Yeah, exactly.
226.25:>>Person3>>But, we we do need a sextant.
229.02:>>Person3>>It looks like they just they they took this from one of the team building exercises where they, where you, you're trapped on a desert island.
240.33:>>Person3>>Because like I don't know why there'd be pistols, or rope- or matches.
244.15:>>Person1>>Yeah I don't I don't I don't think you can I mean those items I rank very low on my list.
249.04:>>Person3>>Yeah, I had the- 
250.46:>>Person1>>I I actually don't know what terrain is like on the moon, so I don't know if you would need nylon rope and other things like that, but we definitely don't need a life raft.
254.14:>>Person3>>Dusty.
256.33:>>Person3>>Well the rope comes-
258.26:>>Person3>>The rope the rope and the parachute silk you could make into a shelter.
262.01:>>Person1>>Right.
262.79:>>Person3>>%HESITATION which is, well actually, this doesn't specify that we have space suits so we might just all be dead anyway.
270.77:>>Person1>>Yeah, exactly. 
274.93:>>Person3>>Yeah, but.
275.26:>>Person1>>Yeah, I mean I guess I don't know exactly how you'd make a shelter out of those. You can't really- Nothing is going, everything is going to fall down I guess.  Well actually no, it'll it'll stay up I guess.
284.36:>>Person3>>Not, not really the moon does have gravity, just not very much.
287.08:>>Person1>>Yeah very, very, very light, yeah.
289.34:>>Person3>>%HESITATION No, it it's more to get yourself out of the sun, because solar heating would eventually become an issue that's why all the stuff we sent we sent up there is white.
292.51:>>Person1>>Right, okay.
301.27:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
304.18:>>Person3>>But I put those ninth and tenth.
306.78:>>Person1>>I'd actually I'd actually put the portable heating unit as four.
310.74:>>Person2>>I put that as sixth, I think-
312.99:>>Person3>>I put that as eighth.
317.79:>>Person1>>So, what do we want to agree on for four? 
322.1:>>Person2>>Either compass or map?
324.4:>>Person3>>Yeah, I I think the compass and the map should be fourth and fifth probably.
324.68:>>Person1>>Compass or map?
328.3:>>Person1>>Okay.
329.86:>>Person3>>But, I'm not sure particularly which order.
334.23:>>Person2>>Either one.
335.66:>>Person1>>I mean without them the map we can't really use the compass.
339.04:>>Person3>>Well, again I don't remember if magnetic compasses work on the moon.
339.26:>>Person1>>We don't know the direction.
341.33:>>Person1>>Exactly I don't know- I mean actually I have compass as ninth because that was my reasoning I don't know if we- they work. I mean there-
343.77:>>Person3>>I'm pretty sure they do.
348.18:>>Person3>>Wait.
350.12:>>Person3>>The moon does have magnetic field.
350.5:>>Person1>>I don't know
353.58:>>Person2>>It does?
354.34:>>Person3>>Yeah. So we can use that.
354.37:>>Person1>>Does it? Okay.
358.65:>>Person3>>And then the problem with the stellar map is we like if we had a sextant and the stellar map we could figure out where we are down to like ten feet. But like we don't because apparently that I guess it got broken or something.
374.07:>>Person3>>They were they were using sextants and during the Apollo missions.
374.24:>>Person1>>Okay.
377.83:>>Person1>>So,
377.86:>>Person3>>Very fancy ones, but.
380.61:>>Person1>>Four, map and five, compass. 
383.24:>>Person3>>Yeah that sounds reasonable.
388.87:>>Person3>>What'd I put for for six? I put the radio for six, because we can like call for help.
392.66:>>Person1>>Yeah I had radio high up as well, so I had had that at six- three.
396.49:>>Person2>>I had the %HESITATION heating unit as six and the radio as seven.
402.5:>>Person2>>I think the when we are going searching for the thing, we need the heating unit when we are working.
412.14:>>Person3>>I think I'm-
414.05:>>Person2>>When we get out from the spaceship we need something to prevent heat.
421.58:>>Person3>>I mean I I think- %HESITATION 
426.8:>>Person3>>From-
430.38:>>Person3>>%HESITATION From my perspective I think it it %HESITATION cooling may actually become more of a concern given that like we have solar heating constantly.
437.51:>>Person1>>Exactly, yeah so we don't need the heating.
443.7:>>Person2>>So what's the heating unit for? 
446.27:>>Person3>>I don't know.
448.04:>>Person2>>So it's just to adjust the temperature?
450.94:>>Person3>>I mean yeah but like I I I think it's just kind of there. I don't know I don't think particularly hypothermia is going to be a massive concern.
463.64:>>Person3>>I mean I think us getting lost and dying a hundred miles in is going to be the problem.
471.45:>>Person1>>So, how about the, the FM receiver transmitter as six?
471.79:>>Person2>>Okay, let's put the radio.
478.28:>>Person3>>Yeah.
484.72:>>Person3>>Okay, what-
487.57:>>Person3>>What what's seventh?
491.24:>>Person2>>And we can also, I I chose to signal as eight because we can-
497.97:>>Person1>>What about seven?
500.31:>>Person3>>We haven't done seven yet.
501.55:>>Person2>>Oh seven, I mean, I mean just the signal is %HESITATION my next one after the radio. So I think we can receive the signal now and that we need to send out a signal. So I put that.
504.06:>>Person1>>Oh you're trying to-
518.51:>>Person3>>So signal flare for seven.
520.34:>>Person1>>Okay.
522.35:>>Person3>>Cool.
523.78:>>Person3>>Oh, can we all agree that the life raft is useless and is fifteenth?
528.35:>>Person1>>Yes. (Laughter)
530.36:>>Person2>>Okay.
532.13:>>Person3>>Because there's no water on the moon, or at least there's no there isn't, we're not gonna be rowing two hundred miles. And if someone suggested to me that I row for two hundred miles I would have a very strong opinion with, or a very strong reaction.
548.43:>>Person2>>And we can put maybe the silk or rope as thirteen or fourteen.
556.72:>>Person3>>I think the rope might actually be useful particularly if we have to do any sort of like mountaineering or anything getting over obstacles.
562.78:>>Person1>>Yeah, exactly, yeah. The terrain might be a little difficult. I mean I was gonna say like fourteen, the pistols would be fourteen, I don't think you need those.
566.42:>>Person3>>Because there there are creators and stuff.
570.46:>>Person1>>Especially for standard theory I don't know why you'd need those.
575.15:>>Person3>>I mean, generally the reason that spacecraft have fire, or some spacecraft do have firearms on in them is for not really in the space part of things because there isn't much alive out there that will be problematic. It's more for like when when you come down and the the Russians in particular because they land they were landing capsules in like forest in the middle of central Russia of that have problems with bears and wolves and stuff, so.
585.93:>>Person2>>Oh.
599.03:>>Person1>>Right, right yeah.
599.46:>>Person2>>Okay, yeah, yeah.
603.6:>>Person1>>Right, well in this case there's no need for them.
607.17:>>Person1>>So I was going to put those as fourteen.
607.26:>>Person2>>Okay, choose that at fourteen? Okay. 
611.22:>>Person3>>Yeah, that's fairly reasonable. I don't think the matches are gonna be useful, they don't really contain or they don't contain a fuel and oxidizer.
615.02:>>Person1>>Yeah, exactly. 
618.85:>>Person1>>So that was thirteen, that's my ranking. Okay good, good.
624.25:>>Person3>>%HESITATION I don't think the first aid, or what do you guys think about the first aid kit?
628.61:>>Person1>>Umm.
629.87:>>Person2>>I think for the-
631.15:>>Person1>>Not as important as some of the other things I guess, but in this case %HESITATION we have what? Dehydrated milk, first aid kit, heating unit and then the tracking stuff, so.
636.76:>>Person2>>I think it's higher-
640.68:>>Person2>>Yeahm I think it's higher than the milk, and maybe lower than other things.
646.32:>>Person1>>Yeah, uh, I was thinking of putting that as eight, actually.
648.16:>>Person3>>Yeah, because if one of us trips.
650.88:>>Person3>>Yeah because like if someone trips and- and cracks their head on something that would be- well if you crack your head on something your spacesuit's busting but-
655.67:>>Person1>>Yeah, exactly.
662.15:>>Person3>>So, eighth?
662.26:>>Person2>>Maybe we can put the milk as twelve?
662.55:>>Person1>>It is eight, yeah. 
664.64:>>Person2>>Yeah.
665.66:>>Person1>>Twelve. 
667.91:>>Person1>>%HESITATION Milk is twelve. Two hundred miles is a long distance, though, but.
674.49:>>Person2>>How long we should take to finish the trip? Two hundred miles if we are on the right direction.
679.42:>>Person3>>%HESITATION If we can go four miles an hour it'll take us two days straight walking.
686.04:>>Person2>>Okay.
686.87:>>Person3>>No, a little more than that.
689.41:>>Person2>>But we have the food concentrate.
692.4:>>Person1>>Yeah, exactly so. 
692.58:>>Person3>>Actually, well, five gallons between three people.
696.81:>>Person2>>And milk would be not so easy to carry.
698.84:>>Person3>>Well, the-
701.23:>>Person3>>Yeah.
702.64:>>Person1>>Or in case of, yeah.
706.31:>>Person2>>Oh but it's dehydrated.
713.98:>>Person3>>So we'd each have like a little under two gallons of water each like a gallon and two thirds
714.56:>>Person1>>Well I think now, it's pretty straight-
721.8:>>Person3>>And-
726.48:>>Person3>>You could make that last like three and a half days so if we just walk straight through and don't sleep we could make it.
730.34:>>Person1>>Yeah you're right, actually.  I don't think we, yeah I think the other things are more important than the dehydrated milk I think at this point.  So we can rank those and then that'll be probably twelfth.
739.34:>>Person2>>Yeah, okay.
739.92:>>Person3>>Yeah.
742.66:>>Person3>>%HESITATION I think the rope would would be a good candidate for ninth, because it it, rope is always handy. I've never been in a situation where I've been like man I wish I didn't have this rope. 
743.27:>>Person1>>So- 
753.92:>>Person2>>(Laughter)
756.95:>>Person3>>I have been in some of the other situations on the other side of things before.
761.74:>>Person1>>Now it's between the parachute silk and heating unit.
768.22:>>Person2>>Parachute silk?
771.51:>>Person3>>I think, do you think and I mean it comes down to do you think we can stave off hypothermia for three days?
777.41:>>Person1>>%HESITATION if it's, dark, if it's night time I don't think it's the temperatures probably going to get-
781.94:>>Person3>>There's no night on the moon.
784.25:>>Person1>>I mean if, oh yeah you're right.
785.14:>>Person2>>So we use the-
785.58:>>Person3>>We're on, and we're on the light side so it's always bright out.
788.43:>>Person1>>We're always on the bright side?
790.17:>>Person3>>Yeah.
796.47:>>Person3>>Which is why I said I was so I thought I was under the impression that solar heating would be a bit more of a concern than %HESITATION perhaps freezing to death would, also because of space- generally spacesuits are really nicely heavily insulated.
813.83:>>Person1>>Right yeah, well in that case then we don't need the heating unit.
818.71:>>Person3>>Yeah, so.
819.72:>>Person2>>Actually I think the heating unit is for food.
820.11:>>Person1>>So ten. 
822.89:>>Person1>>Could be.
824.51:>>Person3>>I'll eat cold food.
824.66:>>Person2>>Yeah.
826.86:>>Person2>>No, I mean maybe just a small one, so you can not use to warm yourself.
836.05:>>Person3>>I mean it's-
839.7:>>Person3>>I don't think it's-
840.82:>>Person2>>But I think the silk might be too big, so if you-
844.13:>>Person1>>Might be too big. 
846.12:>>Person3>>I mean if if this was like if we were on an island in the Pacific Ocean, I could make boat out of this stuff and get us two hundred miles easy. The moon is a little trickier.
853.86:>>Person1>>Yeah. (Laughter)
858.56:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
864.75:>>Person3>>I mean-
867.58:>>Person3>>I don't think it's-
874.62:>>Person2>>Let's choose which one is easier to carry.
878.31:>>Person1>>Carry around, yeah.
881.52:>>Person3>>I'm not sure- the problem is I don't know we don't know the dimensions of either the silk or the heating unit, and at what it's I think what is coming down to is which one weighs more and is bigger.
885.97:>>Person2>>Yeah.
894.12:>>Person1>>What can we use the silk for?
896.33:>>Person3>>%HESITATION Shade.
898.37:>>Person1>>Okay.
