1.091:>>Person1>>okay so can we at least agree that  oxygen is number one because without breathing nothing's gonna happen 
6.438:>>Person2>>yeah I put that 
6.626:>>Person3>>step one not dying 
8.213:>>Person1>>woo let's not die kay that's great %HESITATION 
8.213:>>Person1>>can we also agree that the box of matches is useless because we're not wasting our oxygen on setting a fire
8.288:>>Person4>>
8.292:>>Person5>>yes
18.149:>>Person3>>well but isn't cold on the moon 
19.859:>>Person1>>that's why you have the heater
22.56:>>Person3>>but do you need the matches for the heater 
23.747:>>Person1>>no
24.499:>>Person2>>I was thinking we might need the matches for the heater
25.765:>>Person3>>that was my thought that the heater is dependent on the matches
28.803:>>Person1>>okay never mind we'll come back to that
28.803:>>Person1>>number two 
30.585:>>Person2>>hahaha
32.479:>>Person2>>I said water okay
33.303:>>Person1>>yeah that's what I put okay cool yeah consensing %HESITATION that's not a word %HESITATION
33.432:>>Person4>>water 
33.72:>>Person3>>water 
37.545:>>Person2>>I said food as three
39.891:>>Person4>>yeah 
39.945:>>Person3>>what a strange 
40.448:>>Person1>>I said stellar map because I know that you can survive a lot longer on just food and
45.414:>>Person1>>than I mean just water than like food %HESITATION and I know that you're just going to be walking aimlessly if we don't have a map but like
56.766:>>Person3>>we have to stay alive in order to walk 
59.432:>>Person3>>and if you're walking two hundred miles you're gonna need energy especially if you're wearing like a space suit or something
63.703:>>Person1>>also true but there's not much gravity 
66.605:>>Person2>>I was thinking like primary needs plus if we're carrying like hundred tanks of oxygen we're gonna need that
68.657:>>Person4>>yeah 
71.617:>>Person3>>in order 
71.641:>>Person5>>
71.663:>>Person4>>yeah 
71.764:>>Person1>>also true okay 
75.597:>>Person2>>so food is three 
75.798:>>Person4>>
75.975:>>Person1>>food three 
79.914:>>Person3>>four 
80.024:>>Person2>>do you wanna do map is four? 
82.153:>>Person1>>map is four? 
83.193:>>Person5>>that works
84.063:>>Person1>>yeah okay awesome
85.661:>>Person1>>now we know now we're alive and we know where we're going 
87.705:>>Person2>>yeah 
87.705:>>Person2>>I was thinking %HESITATION magnetic compass but I don't know if that will work on the moon 
94.437:>>Person1>>magnetism isn't a thing 
94.697:>>Person3>>but doesn't moon also have magnetic poles
98.309:>>Person5>>it might be weaker though
102.305:>>Person1>>are they different
103.918:>>Person5>> 
105.028:>>Person1>>are they useful
106.436:>>Person2>>we have a map though 
107.283:>>Person1>>we have a map 
109.738:>>Person3>>if we're astronauts we probably know how to use the compass
111.018>>Person2>>yeah that's what I was kind of thinking
113.859:>>Person2>>we can come back to that idea 
114.66:>>Person1>>wait but shouldn't we take care of our it's freezing on the moon problem 
118.443:>>Person2>>yeah let's do heat then 
120.325:>>Person2>>you wanna do the heating unit 
122.694:>>Person1>>yes
123.948:>>Person5>>we could put matches and the heating unit like together
125.713:>>Person2>>right right other 
126.953:>>Person1>>yeah okay so 
127.81:>>Person2>>so like 
127.986:>>Person3>>so matches at five and heating unit is six
129.422:>>Person1>>I would do heating unit one first
133.177:>>Person1>>so five heating
133.829:>>Person2>>five heating
134.298:>>Person3>>I just I don't
137.108:>>Person1>>six matches 
138.255:>>Person3>>we're underspecifying 
139.787:>>Person3>>whether we really need the matches or not
140.021:>>Person2>>
143.753:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I don't know portable things I usually assume I don't need that much stuff to go with them
148.781:>>Person3>>Cause having used a lot of like portable heating units I usually have to light the body using
150.955:>>Person2>>yeah usually it's like a light the fire
151.815:>>Person3>>propane 
153.597:>>Person1>>I don't know this is NASA NASA can do some pretty cool things
153.773:>>Person5>>I mean 
155.719:>>Person1>>unless it's SpaceX
156.542:>>Person5>>at first when I saw the matches I thought they mean like make a fire and I'm like that would be dumb
162.899:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
164.102:>>Person3>>but 
164.917:>>Person5>>like a physical fire
172.811:>>Person1>>can we have rope because when you don't wanna carry those oxygen tanks you can tie them and drag them or you can like tie them to yourself
176.719:>>Person1>>or to like track order 
176.805:>>Person3>>hmm
179.014:>>Person1>>or if like you need a nap and you need to like trace your steps so you know where you're going
183.929:>>Person3>>I think we're moving too fast
184.581:>>Person1>>okay cool
185.893:>>Person3>>we need to we need to decide about matches and heating unit 
187.712:>>Person4>>yeah 
189.515:>>Person1>>well I just put nablahblahblah
194.159:>>Person3>>because because if the portable heating works all by itself then we're done but
198.457:>>Person3>>if it needs the matches and we don't have the matches
202.206:>>Person3>>then what's the point in even having it
202.714:>>Person1>>I'm gonna assume I mean part of me wants to say NASA has the technology to make a portable heating unit that you don't need matches for %HESITATION hand warm
206.735:>>Person3>>I'm not too sure about that
208.541:>>Person1>>hand warmers you don't matches for you literally just shove them in your gloves and they warm up your hands and then they turn burning hot and then you're like oh my god get this thing off me %HESITATION so I mean 
220.101:>>Person3>>that that is also oxygen dependent
223.236:>>Person1>>you have oxygen in your spacesuit
223.236:>>Person1>>that's why we have the giant oxygen tanks
224.739:>>Person3>>which is 
227.349:>>Person2>>like the heating unit 
227.358:>>Person3>>but that's like 
227.358:>>Person3>>depedent on other things
234.379:>>Person1>>the heating unit warms up your space suit shove it in okay that's not how this works
237.241:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
238.649:>>Person1>>okay so those are five and six possibly 
242.709:>>Person1>>let's go 
242.95:>>Person3>>I think we agree that the two of them are five and six 
246.135:>>Person1>>collectively 
247.311:>>Person3>>but 
249.532:>>Person2>>we just haven't decided which we can just leave it as a slash for now
251.654:>>Person3>>then resolve later
252.545:>>Person1>>%HESITATION okay cool 
255.808:>>Person2>>okay so you're saying the rope for the next one?
257.951:>>Person1>>rope yeah
260.116:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
260.857:>>Person1>>need that 
261.339:>>Person5>>oh wait what about a first aid kit
262.815:>>Person1>>%HESITATION well what what do you injure yourself first with on the moon 
262.95:>>Person2>>yeah I was thinking of putting that 
263.584:>>Person4>>yeah 
263.609:>>Person3>>but I put first aid kit earlier yeah 
267.201:>>Person2>>well if we just crashed we might have some injuries
269.601:>>Person3>>we crash and then we have to carry heavy things
270.493:>>Person4>>yeah 
270.493:>>Person4>>a little more 
271.526:>>Person1>>I'm assuming your injuries are %HESITATION a little more severe than a little band aid can cover but maybe NASA's first aid kits are pretty you know high tech and have like you know intense bandaids 
271.655:>>Person5>>injection needles I mean
282.203:>>Person3>>I don't
282.224:>>Person2>>there might be moon diseases we don't know about
286.314:>>Person3>>you have diseases you have impact things and %HESITATION strain injuries heat cold overwork
286.329:>>Person1>>the disease of gravity 
286.81:>>Person5>>
287.285:>>Person4>>
289.894:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
291.342:>>Person1>>okay cool 
291.342:>>Person1>>yeah sound logic 
296.752:>>Person2>>okay so seven seven 
297.181:>>Person4>>so that can be our seven 
297.356:>>Person1>>seven 
297.696:>>Person3>>that would be seven 
299.881:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
302.775:>>Person1>>what about the solar powered FM receiver transmitter because 
305.481:>>Person2>>I was thinking that one should be high up there too cause then we can be like yo we're on our way 
310.185:>>Person1>>talk to people 
311.744:>>Person4>>
311.949:>>Person5>>I mean I also kind of put that one with like the signal flares cause I feel like it serves a similar purpose 
316.684:>>Person1>>well doesn't flare need oxygen but the 
319.856:>>Person1>>radio connect to like
322.908:>>Person5>>but I also feel like both of them will like alert people that you're on your way
327.05:>>Person3>>I agree but the
329.636:>>Person3>>the power of the message with the radio is a lot more powerful because it's not just like here's our location but like how are we doing 
336.549:>>Person1>>so should we put radio at eight or should we move it up to %HESITATION five and scoot the other ones back down one 
345.114:>>Person3>>I think 
346.586:>>Person3>>I think staying alive is still our primary goal 
348.485:>>Person1>>more important 
348.562:>>Person2>>yeah than communicating 
348.809:>>Person4>>yeah 
350.382:>>Person1>>okay cool 
350.861:>>Person3>>and that helps of 
350.861:>>Person3>>not be stranded on the moon but 
352.576:>>Person1>>get places 
353.17:>>Person2>>yeah 
355.25:>>Person2>>so eight for the radio 
358.168:>>Person1>>nice nice %HESITATION
364.574:>>Person5>>I'm really curious what would you need a pistol for?
366.203:>>Person1>>%HESITATION to kill aliens 
367.428:>>Person5>>hahaha
367.653:>>Person2>>hahaha
367.847:>>Person4>>hahaha
367.999:>>Person3>>I know in the past I've done a similar task not on the moon
369.857:>>Person4>>
370.732:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
372.364:>>Person1>>I I have shot pistols at targets does that count?
376.929:>>Person1>>probably not probably not %HESITATION 
378.019:>>Person3>>you could
380.691:>>Person1>>can we 
381.143:>>Person3>>to propel yourself through space right?
382.729:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
383.242:>>Person2>>oh that's true 
385.734:>>Person3>>but not very much
386.283:>>Person2>>not really the primary use yeah 
386.283:>>Person2>>so maybe save that one %HESITATION should we put the life raft up there early one of there's some room 
388.091:>>Person3>>
392.341:>>Person1>>
394.803:>>Person1>>can we do the rope before life raft I have a feeling like I would rather do %HESITATION rope
397.362:>>Person2>>yeah 
399.478:>>Person3>>it's just what is the purpose of the life raft
400.999:>>Person4>>yeah
401.263:>>Person2>>I don't know
401.343:>>Person1>>to hold all your crap 
403.713:>>Person2>>you could use it to carry stuff or like if we come across a moon river like 
405.682:>>Person1>>take a nap on it it's probably more comfortable than sleeping on the rocks you could sleep on it
413.048:>>Person1>>you could sleep on it. coverage from moon debris
413.472:>>Person5>>try sleeping on it
414.471:>>Person2>>yeah 
414.692:>>Person3>>I mean cause you don't really need shelter on the moon
417.533:>>Person1>>I mean I know debris like flies and you can get
418.55:>>Person3>>maybe on Earth
421.121:>>Person1>>hit by like a space rock
424.566:>>Person1>>sorry the thought of that is just like
424.764:>>Person2>>I'm not sure how much a life raft would prevent from
425.505:>>Person3>>I mean in like micro gravity I agree 
430.387:>>Person3>>on the moon itself maybe not
432.502:>>Person5>>what would the what would the parachute silk do would that be like a similar function
438.134:>>Person3>>I have actually no idea
439.105:>>Person2>>yeah I didn't I ranked that one really low so
yeah yeah same
439.117:>>Person5>>
439.161:>>Person1>>I'm not I'm not I'm not para
439.225:>>Person4>>yeah 
439.358:>>Person3>>that was ha ha
441.519:>>Person3>>that was fourteen for me and the guns were fifteen because I'm just
442.184:>>Person2>>yeah same
444.337:>>Person1>>I'm not power shooting off the moon I don't know about you %HESITATION but I think we should figure out where the heck we're going before we try some leisurely activities 
447.483:>>Person5>>hahaha 
447.521:>>Person2>>haha
449.603:>>Person3>>we could just leave it at the crash and forget about it
452.025:>>Person2>>yeah can we just like not carry the parachute with us like haha
455.075:>>Person1>>okay cool %HESITATION we can stick that in a life raft just to like drag %HESITATION 
455.075:>>Person2>>true true true
458.119:>>Person1>>so rope nine?
463.517:>>Person4>>yeah 
463.541:>>Person1>>kay cool %HESITATION 
467.242:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
470.249:>>Person2>>maybe the compass next just like if it does work or at least like we have an idea even if the we know the  that we're going at least the same direction the whole time you know 
475.177:>>Person1>>and even if it doesn't work it's kind of small 
475.322:>>Person5>>okay 
475.819:>>Person3>>mhm
478.183:>>Person5>>that we are indeed going in a straight line right
483.771:>>Person2>>right 
485.013:>>Person1>>nice nice 
487.164:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
487.164:>>Person1>>signal flares next
491.215:>>Person1>>sure 
493.275:>>Person1>>because it's more useful than most other stuff that's left 
495.187:>>Person2>>we'd have to use a match to light them though 
497.766:>>Person5>>what about the milk?
499.074:>>Person1>>%HESITATION milk is useless because we have water and water will keep you alive 
503.231:>>Person3>>I had milk with food because it's a good src of calories and protein things that will keep your muscles warm and mobilizing 
509.879:>>Person2>want to put it 
513.56:>>Person1>>honestly five gallons of water isn't gonna last you that long so like if you really need 
517.881:>>Person2>>but if it's dehydrated milk then we'd have to hydrate it with the water instead of hydrating ourselves
522.487:>>Person1>>and that's how pretty much everything to be honest
524.169:>>Person3>>well but we would then be hydrating ourselves with the milk
526.182:>>Person2>>that's fair
529.019:>>Person3>>like
529.196:>>Person1>>but water definitely has better 
529.779:>>Person3>>as an added 
532.757:>>Person1>>help as you staying life 
535.33:>>Person3>>water by itself I agree but as because we have water we can also use the milk sort of
541.346:>>Person3>>along with the food as another src of energy
547.061:>>Person2>>because it's like easier to break down and stuff 
547.611:>>Person1>>so number eleven 
551.481:>>Person5>>I feel like if you put that next it't not like super high up on the list but it's still something that is not determined 
553.824:>>Person1>>not nothing 
554.158:>>Person3>>it's not useless but it's not that important 
555.53:>>Person2>>yeah I think it's pretty nice right 
557.383:>>Person1>>it's not important okay cool number eleven dehydrated milk
561.204:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
562.852:>>Person1>>twelve 
562.852:>>Person1>>let's we can go with the life raft 
565.805:>>Person3>>I think of the things that we have the life raft is the least useless to us
569.507:>>Person5>>hahaha
569.552:>>Person2>>yeah hahaha
569.583:>>Person1>>great reasoning %HESITATION
571.394:>>Person5>>haha
575.44:>>Person2>>so maybe 
575.44:>>Person2>>I don't know like 
575.44:>>Person2>>could we do pistols fifteen yeah woo I mean I can hit a bullseye but I don't know how great that's going to be on the moon 
576.71:>>Person2>>yeah that's fine with me
578.402:>>Person5>>yeah 
578.431:>>Person4>>yeah 
578.655:>>Person3>>yeah 
582.056:>>Person2>>I just feel like they'd be kind of useless 
583.626:>>Person3>>but you also don't you need oxygen to shoot things
586.108:>>Person5>>yeah
590.486:>>Person1>>I don't know how they work
590.587:>>Person2>>maybe that's true
591.159:>>Person5>>I
591.44:>>Person3>>explosion's happening there's like gunpowder 
593.881:>>Person5>>I also could just see that like dangerously like oops I just tripped over this and we all die
596.128:>>Person2>>yeah 
596.128:>>Person2>>for like a two hundred long journey like 
597.176:>>Person4>>hahaha
600.075:>>Person3>>I mean
601.345:>>Person3>>how do you deal with a gunshot on the moon our injection needles are not going to be helping
602.119:>>Person2>>maybe if we get hungry we can kill each other but yeah 
602.75:>>Person5>>
602.866:>>Person4>>hahaha
605.258:>>Person4>>what
607.812:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I want to go with I don't even know what's next
611.698:>>Person2>>I don't know 
611.92:>>Person3>>between the parachute silk and the signal flares signal flares we could theoretically use even though we don't really need them
618.008:>>Person3>>where as the parachute silk
620.662:>>Person2>>I just don't see a purpose
621.583:>>Person3>>I don't see any purpose it's gonna it's big and annoying
627.48:>>Person2>>so thirteen fourteen 
628.212:>>Person3>>so that would be 
629.75:>>Person1>>oh wait I totally zoned out for a second %HESITATION 
629.823:>>Person5>>so silk fourteen?
633.839:>>Person4>>yeah 
634.429:>>Person3>>there are no uses for the silk that we can determine 
637.195:>>Person1>>okay cool
637.283:>>Person2>>and then
637.36:>>Person3>>there is a use for the flares we just don't
639.434:>>Person2>>right 
640.952:>>Person2>>okay 
641.06:>>Person1>>okay now back to that heating versus matches debate %HESITATION
641.218:>>Person2>>matches and heating
641.731:>>Person4>>haha
643.86:>>Person3>>so 
645.109:>>Person3>>
648.328:>>Person1>>I wanna believe in NASA maybe it's battery powered 
652.44:>>Person1>>and with lithium batteries that last a while 
656.977:>>Person3>>I don't believe in NASA
659.126:>>Person5>>hahaha
659.145:>>Person2>>hahaha
659.218:>>Person3>>my boyfriend's actually interning there right now and it's
663.151:>>Person3>>it's not what you would imagine
663.186:>>Person1>>we give enough money to NASA we we I believe in them 
671.553:>>Person4>>I mean box of matches 
671.772:>>Person1>>anybody else have any cool input 
671.879:>>Person4>>the box of matches is easier to carry with the problem about weight
674.871:>>Person5>>also like the matches will create heat by itself like no matter what whereas the heating unit could or could not create heat by itself
677.356:>>Person3>>and there 
685.535:>>Person2>>plus it could like run out of battery or 
685.554:>>Person3>>and we could find other things to burn or something 
689.102:>>Person1>>what else could you burn
689.464:>>Person2>>we could burn the parachute silk
690.094:>>Person5>>hahaha
690.193:>>Person4>>hahaha
690.318:>>Person1>>yes silk does burn well I know that 
690.403:>>Person3>>hahaha
697.774:>>Person1>>okay fine I am relinquishing my adamant thing that I am 
700.173:>>Person2>>five 
700.43:>>Person4>>alright five
700.528:>>Person3>>five 
705.922:>>Person2>>woo consensus
705.981:>>Person3>>are there any other points of disagreement can we make this better in some way  
706.493:>>Person1>>no that was it
713.984:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
716.114:>>Person1>>no
717.122:>>Person2>>seems pretty good 
721.424:>>Person3>>like I'm not asking 'cause I don't think it's good
723.0:>>Person2>>haha
723.376:>>Person3>>like that's my %HESITATION go to, how can we optimize
723.489:>>Person5>>yes
727.84:>>Person1>>I don't know this is slightly different than mine but like my personal opinion
728.143:>>Person5>>mhm that's good
733.245:>>Person1>>I'm not dating someone who's interning at NASA your opinion might have more of reasoning than mine
