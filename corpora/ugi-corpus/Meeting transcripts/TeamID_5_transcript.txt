0.0:>>Person2>>so first what we want to do is sort of a right 
0.997:>>Person3>>okay so first what we might want to do is sort of get a ranking for each item
5.487:>>Person3>>item what everyone thinks and then talk about the differences 
5.791:>>Person2>>when everyone 
8.862:>>Person2>>so lots of matches 
9.275:>>Person3>>so for the box of matches how did you all rank it
13.984:>>Person1>>eleven 
13.994:>>Person4>>I was 
14.012:>>Person3>>twelve eleven
14.012:>>Person2>>I put eight  
14.012:>>Person3>>eleven eight twelve I did twelve as well food concentrate 
18.974:>>Person2>>
20.722:>>Person2>>concentrate 
22.957:>>Person4>>two 
23.021:>>Person3>>okay 
24.297:>>Person1>>twelve 
25.714:>>Person3>>twelve 
25.714:>>Person2>>I put three 
25.714:>>Person3>>I put five fifty feet of nylon rope I put seven 
29.112:>>Person2>>fifty feet of nylon rope 
32.046:>>Person1>> eight
32.284:>>Person4>>eight 
33.129:>>Person3>>so 
33.129:>>Person3>>eight eight ten parachute silk I put eleven 
33.224:>>Person2>>
36.455:>>Person2>>so 
38.395:>>Person1>>thirteen
38.646:>>Person4>>thirteen 
38.876:>>Person3>>
39.513:>>Person2>>eleven 
42.946:>>Person3>>portable heating unit I put six 
43.375:>>Person2>> 
45.252:>>Person1>>seven 
46.382:>>Person4>>eleven 
46.441:>>Person3>>
47.002:>>Person2>>nine 
47.93:>>Person3>>okay two forty five caliber pistol I put at thirteen 
48.678:>>Person2>>two forty five caliber pistol that 
51.434:>>Person1>>three
52.975:>>Person2>>so three fourteen 
53.39:>>Person3>>so three fourteen fifteen 
53.39:>>Person1>>it was originally one for me
53.39:>>Person3>>one 
53.39:>>Person3>>okay one case of dehydrated milk I put fifteen 
56.624:>>Person4>>was originally 
56.667:>>Person2>>
59.094:>>Person2>>one case 
62.248:>>Person4>>ten
62.99:>>Person1>> nine
62.999:>>Person3>>
63.595:>>Person2>>thirteen 
64.583:>>Person3>>thirteen two one hundred pound takes of oxygen I put one 
66.095:>>Person2>> one
66.108:>>Person4>>
68.606:>>Person1>> one
68.979:>>Person4>>zero 
68.979:>>Person4>>what 
68.979:>>Person3>>that one everyone put one okay so that's definitely one 
70.233:>>Person3>>one yeah %HESITATION stellar map of the moon's constellation I put two 
70.346:>>Person4>>six
70.346:>>Person4>>ten
81.383:>>Person2>>four 
82.766:>>Person3>>ten six four life raft I put fourteen 
85.815:>>Person1>> fifteen
86.369:>>Person4>>nine 
87.462:>>Person2>>Fourteen
87.51:>>Person3>>fourteen nine magnetic compass I put ten 
90.656:>>Person4>> seven
93.945:>>Person1>> fourteen
94.843:>>Person2>>five 
94.869:>>Person3>>five gallons of water I put four 
96.12:>>Person4>>what 
97.916:>>Person1>>two 
98.786:>>Person3>>two you said
98.786:>>Person3>>two 
98.786:>>Person4>>two 
98.786:>>Person3>>okay signal flares I put eight 
103.853:>>Person1>>six 
 106.123:>>Person4>>five 
106.115:>>Person2>>twelve
106.131:>>Person3>>
108.106:>>Person3>>okay a first aid kit containing injection needles I put nine 
111.391:>>Person1>>four 
112.013:>>Person4>>three 
112.638:>>Person3>>
113.189:>>Person2>>seven seven and solar powered FM receiver transmitter I put three
118.569:>>Person1>> five
118.576:>>Person4>> four 
119.179:>>Person2>>six
120.173:>>Person3>>four five six okay 
122.453:>>Person2>>I think I think %HESITATION was it the five gallons of water we all want to set 
126.59:>>Person3>>yep five gallons of water except for me I put four 
126.59:>>Person3>>%HESITATION and my reasoning was sort of were only walking two hundred miles %HESITATION we can go without water for on the time it will probably take us especially in lower gravity too and 
126.59:>>Person3>>I put the steller map because my thought was it's kind of vague on what it's saying but my thought was sort of that would give us a way to navigate on the moon as it's looking at the constellations from the moon's perspective 
126.749:>>Person1>> well yeah
130.248:>>Person3>>that was my thought but it's kind of vague 
130.248:>>Person3>>%HESITATION and then my three was the FM receiver transmitter so the people of the mother ship know we are coming and can talk to us when were nearby 
164.4:>>Person1>>I'll agree with the southern up because 
164.422:>>Person1>>I will agree with the steller map because 
164.823:>>Person2>>
167.344:>>Person1>>you can't walk a lot places on the moon
167.344:>>Person1>>you need a way to figure out what where you're going 

172.83:>>Person2>>and I think also along with the stellar map the magnetic compass like 
172.873:>>Person3>>well I don't know if there is a magnetic field on the moon 
172.873:>>Person1>>I don't think the moon has
172.873:>>Person3>>that's why I put it so low because I wasn't sure
172.873:>>Person1>>I don't know if the moon has a melting core
172.873:>>Person3>>yeah I don't think so 
173.681:>>Person2>> oh that makes sense
173.681:>>Person3>>otherwise I would agree with you our 

187.616:>>Person1>>are we assuming our moon
190.904:>>Person1>>as if we have a mother ship and we are in the future 
190.948:>>Person3>>
193.189:>>Person3>>our moon okay so yeah I I don't think there's a molten core so I don't think that matters at all 
193.189:>>Person4>>so how would you navigate without a compass
193.189:>>Person3>>I would say the Steller map 
193.189:>>Person4>>oh just the map
193.189:>>Person3>>well it it's got a map of of constellations from this perspective yeah 
193.189:>>Person1>>I mean as long as you know the big dipper and the north star
193.246:>>Person2>>yeah I see 
193.246:>>Person2>>it makes sense  
216.722:>>Person4>>I agree to that so I guess we're 
217.397:>>Person2>>so I guess we're considering the second one as either 
217.397:>>Person2>>the water or the map 
220.555:>>Person4>>
222.609:>>Person4>>or 
224.975:>>Person2>>
227.043:>>Person4>>water is 
227.128:>>Person3>>my thought again was that water is important and nice but not necessarily needed for how long we are going
231.542:>>Person1>>I think food is needed less than water 
231.55:>>Person3>>I agree
233.77:>>Person2>>that's fine 
234.362:>>Person4>>I agree water 
234.753:>>Person1>>water 
240.54:>>Person3>>thats why i put it as five over four

241.991:>>Person1>>the signal flare would be more useful if like 
241.991:>>Person1>>if we don't know where we were going to and somebody that would be a 
241.991:>>Person1>>this is 
250.731:>>Person3>>and if we don't have the transmitter 
250.756:>>Person4>>for 
250.787:>>Person2>>
251.063:>>Person1>> yeah 
252.261:>>Person2>>
254.413:>>Person4>>yeah 
254.494:>>Person3>>because the radio sort of just strictly better version of the signal flare 
254.494:>>Person3>>as my thought 
259.635:>>Person1>>so assuming we're gonna put some other valuable life resrcs too 
265.574:>>Person1>>would you 
266.97:>>Person1>>say 
269.19:>>Person1>>that single flare would be somewhere around three

271.191:>>Person3>>I put them around eight because we have the transmitter transmitter receiver first 
271.191:>>Person3>>and then we've got some other just sort of all purpose utility stuff first like rope
282.379:>>Person3>>when are you ever not gonna need rope right 
285.483:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
285.483:>>Person3>>but so 
285.483:>>Person3>>for water are we at two are we going with the stellar map do you think 
294.582:>>Person3>>I mean I do agree that water is important I'm just not sure 
301.72:>>Person2>>I guess it does make sense with the stellar map given the distant and consider the distance as something like think about 
307.893:>>Person1>>I think it's a pretty high on the list 
307.919:>>Person3>>what do you think 
307.919:>>Person4>>two
307.919:>>Person3>>alright so 
312.427:>>Person2>>
314.62:>>Person3>>then there was sort of disagreement looking at water or sick or the receiver transmitter 
322.15:>>Person4>>I think what you said makes sense what you said you had the receiver and transmitter I don't think you need those signal flare anymore 
322.15:>>Person4>>assuming the receiver transmitter has a broad range  
330.243:>>Person3>>why did you have first aid kit as three
330.243:>>Person3>>you did yeah
335.207:>>Person4>>I have a first aid kit at three just in case someone gets injured
335.207:>>Person4>>%HESITATION 
335.301:>>Person3>>okay 
335.301:>>Person4>>I'm assuming we just recovered from as crash maybe someone needs some pain killers or whatever 
347.061:>>Person3>>that's fair that's fair 
349.022:>>Person4>>or what if you 
349.14:>>Person3>>why did you put pistols 
351.658:>>Person1>>figured if I'm in a group with other people and we're all stranded I don't know their psychology there might be freaks 
358.952:>>Person3>>that's that's a that's a fair criticism 
358.952:>>Person3>>but I'm not sure that for the group it's the right decision right 
367.444:>>Person1>>you can always be in a group and never know how the group works completely 
373.239:>>Person1>>you can make assumptions but you can't
373.239:>>Person4>>so then who would be the two people holding the pistol 
379.26:>>Person3>>right 
380.528:>>Person2>>I mean I just wrote them as last 
380.528:>>Person2>>so so I did 
380.797:>>Person3>>that's sort of inherently 
380.797:>>Person3>>builds tension so so I didn't put them 
380.797:>>Person3>>ah wait I did that the last in 
388.893:>>Person3>>no I didn't I put the hydrated milk last because there's nothing you get from that %HESITATION that doesn't require you already have water and use water 
397.214:>>Person3>>so they're sort of no possible upgrade 
397.214:>>Person3>>from the water 
402.675:>>Person3>>that's why I put that last 
404.631:>>Person2>>makes sense 
405.67:>>Person3>>but sort of we're looking at three 
405.67:>>Person3>>and sort of the options are %HESITATION guns water 
405.67:>>Person3>>%HESITATION transmitter and first aid kit 
418.599:>>Person4>>I would go with water 
420.05:>>Person2>>I think I would agree with the water 
418.599:>>Person3>>yeah 
418.599:>>Person3>>sorry no water yeah water over one 
421.991:>>Person3>>water that's fine 
421.991:>>Person3>>that seems reasonable 
421.991:>>Person3>>would you agree okay 
421.991:>>Person3>>'cause you had that too 
427.321:>>Person2>>
430.498:>>Person1>>I will agree water over guns 
434.809:>>Person3>>I think we're getting a little muddled at the end so let's start at this point so let's go all the way to the end I sort of fifteen we had the pistols the milk 
434.809:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the life raft 
440.42:>>Person2>>so 
445.948:>>Person3>>and there was one other thing where is it 
450.877:>>Person3>>not actually seeing it
453.66:>>Person3>>what did you have for fifteen 
457.333:>>Person4>>this is I think 
459.286:>>Person3>>pistols 
459.912:>>Person4>>yeah 
459.912:>>Person4>>what I have but I signed my number from zero so I might not have a fifteen okay 
460.61:>>Person3>>yeah I had you listed as for 
460.61:>>Person3>>oh okay okay gotcha 
467.327:>>Person3>>you have a fourteen okay that makes sense %HESITATION 
467.327:>>Person3>>to get two people think pistols 
467.327:>>Person3>>I can see it my thought was sort of you get nothing for milk and you might be able to decompose the pistols into something 
478.295:>>Person1>>what do you get out of a life on the moon
480.074:>>Person3>>you could take that apart 
481.897:>>Person1>> hmm
482.952:>>Person1>>for what 
483.074:>>Person3>>depends on what is made up but anything it's made up of that's more useful than milk is my thought 
484.625:>>Person1>>fair enough
490.571:>>Person1>> more useful than milk hmm
498.22:>>Person4>>yeah more useful than milk I can agree to that 
500.986:>>Person3>>so should we put milk is fifteen 
504.34:>>Person4>>or pistons as fifteen
505.959:>>Person3>>I I could be willing to say that we just shouldn't take pistols because that would build inherent conflict in the group 
511.652:>>Person2>>I agree with that I mean the only guy I see what you're saying with the psychological thing with that that would be like the only I think that's only scenario where would want pistols but like you don't want that so you don't want the pistols 
524.109:>>Person3>>it's like every individual person wants pistols but everyone wants other people not to have pistols 
526.793:>>Person1>>true but 
529.199:>>Person1>>a weapon could be used as a tool 
529.199:>>Person1>>in many cases what if we need to break something off that's at a distance 
533.108:>>Person3>>I agree 
540.92:>>Person3>>the question would be would that work on the moon 
543.706:>>Person1>> yes
548.442:>>Person3>>okay 
548.442:>>Person3>>I wasn't sure the firing mechanism I think the firing mechanism might not 
550.104:>>Person1>>yeah I think I think it's going to work 
555.525:>>Person1>>it's 
556.229:>>Person4>>combusts so yeah that makes sense to need oxygen to combust 
557.388:>>Person3>>yeah 
561.381:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
561.381:>>Person2>>I think that gives more of a case for not having the pistols 
562.376:>>Person3>>yeah my thought would only be to take it apart 
576.543:>>Person4>>what part of it would be useful to the group 
580.485:>>Person1>>not useful to have weapons anywhere besides any place with atmosphere 
584.685:>>Person3>>yeah exactly so should we put that is fifteen or fourteen or something 
588.529:>>Person2>>I mean I think we should put it as fifteen 
590.272:>>Person4>>yeah 
592.299:>>Person3>>I I don't want to sort of recommend it 
601.446:>>Person3>>let's sort of table that
602.888:>>Person1>>I think the compass is less
604.607:>>Person3>>all right 
606.219:>>Person3>>I could see that 
608.188:>>Person2>>yeah with no magnetic field and I agree and then maybe 
612.275:>>Person3>>and then maybe that's fifteen and pistols fourteen 
614.952:>>Person3>>and then for thirteen 
617.86:>>Person3>>milk 
622.666:>>Person2>>that's exactly what I put in the start so I I agree with that 
622.694:>>Person3>>that's good for either of you 
629.745:>>Person4>> yeah
629.776:>>Person3>>thirteen
634.614:>>Person1>>trying to reason whether parachute silk would be more or less useful 
634.675:>>Person3>>my thought is sort of at worst it's just a different version of rope
642.882:>>Person1>>either way your body needs water to digest any kind of nutrient
646.873:>>Person3>>but it's dehydrated milk 
651.087:>>Person1>>if you use food concentrate
653.735:>>Person1>> you need water
654.899:>>Person3>>we already have water 
656.143:>>Person1>>okay
658.316:>>Person3>>I just don't see the point in having the dehydrated milk
661.701:>>Person3>>'cause it does sh sh nothing without water and we already have water and it doesn't do anything more for us than water 
 669.404:>>Person1>> if we had more details for comparing the food concentrate and milk
671.304:>>Person3>>right yeah yeah I agree
677.719:>>Person3>>right 
680.004:>>Person3>>twelve %HESITATION I would say life rafts or matches 
680.158:>>Person2>>well I would say life raft definitely 
686.649:>>Person2>>really I don't see the need for it 
688.423:>>Person3>>again we can take it apart 
688.423:>>Person1>>matches 
688.423:>>Person4>>right matches 
690.124:>>Person1>>which is it matches if we're gonna reason that a gun law 
688.423:>>Person3>>right yeah so twelve matches 
688.423:>>Person3>>eleven life right do you think
699.033:>>Person3>>how strong is parachute silk 
701.166:>>Person2>>it's pretty strong you can like you are falling 
701.335:>>Person4>>pretty strong 
704.669:>>Person3>>so would we rank that over rope then 
707.993:>>Person3>> cause it is stronger than rope 
709.556:>>Person1>>how much silk are we talking
710.053:>>Person3>>yeah I don't know I also don't know like how thick across it might be as that might be something in ever rope that's not in favor of parachute silk
719.86:>>Person3>>but I put down my fact as eleven

724.629:>>Person2>>I don't know I think 
724.629:>>Person2>>I would think 
729.808:>>Person2>>rope is a little bit more useful than parachute silk 
733.935:>>Person3>>I would agree 
734.666:>>Person2>>yeah in general like the context yeah 
736.598:>>Person3>>sort of other stuff around the spot around like ten 
736.598:>>Person3>>we had the heating unit 
743.918:>>Person3>>%HESITATION I can understand why that might not be ranked super high 
743.918:>>Person3>>signal flares 
746.236:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
751.387:>>Person2>>I don't really see too much use of the signal flares I mean if it's just like a group altogether 
753.935:>>Person3>>and could concentrate 
753.935:>>Person3>>yeah I I I think the signal flares are strictly worse receiver transmitter 
761.496:>>Person4>>but if the receiver and transmitter failed and we might need the signal flare
765.959:>>Person3>> exactly right
768.192:>>Person4>>as opposed to 
768.417:>>Person3>>yeah I I I can definitely see how having them but 
773.345:>>Person4>>what was the other option if not signal flare
775.47:>>Person3>>I mean the other options are heating unit and rope will not rope but parachute silk 
786.298:>>Person3>>I think I'd rank 
788.122:>>Person4>>the heating doesn't make sense unless you were going to camp out somewhere
792.696:>>Person1>>we're reasoning so much for realizing there a lot of unknowns that would be useful to know 
792.728:>>Person3>>right 
797.104:>>Person3>>yeah I I know a lot of things that would be sort of important for example if any of us are injured 
803.617:>>Person3>>if we're not we can just sort of 
805.475:>>Person1>>we broke her leg whats an injection needle gonna do
807.861:>>Person3>>true 
811.487:>>Person2>>so which ones are we considering right now for 
816.437:>>Person3>>%HESITATION for sort of ten %HESITATION we're looking at parachute Silk heating unit and signal flares 
826.696:>>Person2>>I would say either the silk or the signal flares personally
831.389:>>Person3>>I would rank the heating unit probably least but 
833.802:>>Person4>>silk or heating unit either one of them 
835.772:>>Person1>>unless we are consistent on combustion and signal flares are more useless 
840.267:>>Person3>>%HESITATION that's a good point yeah 
840.267:>>Person3>>that's a good point I didn't think about that 
840.267:>>Person3>>and so that's that's ten yeah that that that's useless %HESITATION 
840.534:>>Person2>>yeah I agree with that that's what 
850.834:>>Person3>>however if combustion does work it would probably be the most useful out of the ones we've listed 
850.834:>>Person3>>the nine 
856.119:>>Person4>>so these signal flares you don't think they would be specially designed
859.911:>>Person3>>oh thats true thats a good point
863.565:>>Person4>>because if they're carrying it to the moon I am assuming that
863.565:>>Person4>>they tested this out 
869.21:>>Person2>>fair point 
871.07:>>Person3>>so many unknowns 
874.161:>>Person3>>we should be consistent because we don't know that they change them and it just says signal flares so let's put that as ten 
874.161:>>Person3>>then for nine it's either heating unit or silk 
885.885:>>Person2>>so I still say silk like yeah 
887.306:>>Person1>>silk 
887.498:>>Person3>>yeah I'll go with silk 
890.237:>>Person3>>heating unit 
890.237:>>Person3>>right 
897.347:>>Person3>>heating unit versus first aid kit at this point 
900.005:>>Person4>>heating unit 
900.005:>>Person4>>right 
900.95:>>Person2>>yeah reading 
903.186:>>Person3>>all right 
903.186:>>Person3>>a little
903.285:>>Person2>>so here
907.075:>>Person4>>
