3.1:>>Person2>>Did everybody put oxygen as number one?
5.48:>>Person3>>Yes, oxygen, food and water.
6.11:>>Person1>>Actually- 
7.1:>>Person2>>Yeah.
8.42:>>Person1>>Actually number two.
9.11:>>Person4>>Yeah.
9.83:>>Person3>>No you can't survive without oxygen.  You can survive with water- you can survive longer without water than oxygen. 
10.07:>>Person1>>Well you can't- yeah.
10.34:>>Person2>>Fair enough.
13.54:>>Person2>>Okay so real quick, ground rules. Are we making this journey for two hundred miles in space suits?
15.36:>>Person1>>That's true.
21.22:>>Person3>>Yes, yes I think so, okay-
21.35:>>Person2>>Yes? Okay.
21.52:>>Person4>>Yeah.
22.98:>>Person1>>I I think that was implied. 
24.5:>>Person4>>(Laughter)
24.52:>>Person3>>Guys, matches should be the least important. There is no oxygen on uh-
24.85:>>Person2>>Gotcha, like the ship isn't working anymore.
29.44:>>Person2>>Yeah.
29.78:>>Person1>>I would argue that a life raft is leaf- least important because there's no water. (Laughter)
33.36:>>Person3>>Yeah and there's no water so yeah, I put- I put it as the- yes I put it as second least.
34.34:>>Person2>>Yeah, and there's no- and there's no magnetic field on the moon, so the compass is also useless.
34.44:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
34.94:>>Person1>>Right yeah that- I- I kind of worked my way backwards through it, going from least to most important.
43.0:>>Person2>>That's fair.
43.01:>>Person3>>Alright, so matches fifteen? Right?
44.96:>>Person1>>Okay.
45.06:>>Person2>>Yeah.
46.03:>>Person3>>Alright.
48.25:>>Person2>>I feel like the last five are all equally useless.
48.38:>>Person3>>And- 
51.11:>>Person4>>Yeah I think that the basis that the moon does not have the atmosphere was like common ground on which we thought and just- yeah.
51.22:>>Person3>>Yeah, yeah.
53.96:>>Person2>>Yeah.
58.0:>>Person2>>Which is why signal flares wouldn't burn either. 
58.08:>>Person1>>Yeah.
60.5:>>Person1>>Well signal flares are self oxidizing. (Laughter)
60.56:>>Person4>>So
62.82:>>Person2>>Are these self oxidizing signal flairs? 
63.34:>>Person4>>They are?
66.27:>>Person3>>I think they have no say, yeah.
66.36:>>Person4>>I don't think they are allowed to contribute to our discussion.
66.38:>>Person2>>Mmm.
66.4:>>Person1>>I mean you can burn them under water.
73.42:>>Person2>>It could just be that easy.
73.78:>>Person3>>Yeah that's the- yeah does it burn? Does it burn though? I put it as-
74.25:>>Person4>>Yeah.
76.18:>>Person2>>We'll put it at the top of our useless list. That's fair.
78.34:>>Person1>>Okay.
79.84:>>Person2>>So anyway, so box of matches fifteen, life raft?
80.34:>>Person4>>Okay.
82.95:>>Person3>>Fourteen.
83.53:>>Person2>>Fourteen.  
83.57:>>Person1>>Fourteen, yeah 
85.24:>>Person4>>Yeah.
85.56:>>Person2>>%HESITATION Magnetic compass, because there's no magnetic field on the moon.
88.42:>>Person1>>Yeah.
88.87:>>Person4>>Yeah 
88.97:>>Person3>>Well, yeah there's no magnetic field.
91.52:>>Person4>>Even the portable heating unit, like if you're inside of a suit, how do you use that? Like- like you are in a cave and you need heat or something like that.
96.45:>>Person1>>That's true.
99.56:>>Person2>>I-
102.87:>>Person2>>I actually rated that one of the highest ones. I thought that %HESITATION 
105.38:>>Person4>>You did?
105.38:>>Person1>>Yeah, me too. 
105.98:>>Person3>>Yeah, me too.
106.98:>>Person4>>So what was your thinking behind it? 
108.75:>>Person2>>%HESITATION Just that if it's a radiant heat unit, then that's- I mean what's gonna keep you warm. I mean I don't know what our suits have or anything, but-
116.7:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
116.78:>>Person4>>Right. I even- I'm not sure what like the suit- whether the suit insulates you through everything but that was my line of thought, that you know, because you're in the suit maybe you won't need a portable heating unit right away.
126.7:>>Person2>>That's fair.
128.95:>>Person3>>Alright guys. Oxygen, gallon, milk oh no. Oxygen, water, and uh food.
134.94:>>Person2>>And food.
136.28:>>Person3>>Alright, one, two and three. Cool? 
136.41:>>Person1>>Yeah.
137.81:>>Person1>>Yeah.
137.84:>>Person2>>Oxygen, water-
139.34:>>Person3>>Oxygen, most important, and then-
141.19:>>Person2>>%HESITATION I actually put food a little bit lower. I was thinking the %HESITATION because this is only two hundred miles. That's-
147.09:>>Person3>>Two hundred miles is like from here to New York.
149.44:>>Person1>>Yeah that that's about five days probably.
149.55:>>Person2>>Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, you're right. 
151.2:>>Person3>>Yeah.
151.86:>>Person4>>You might need food, yeah.
154.24:>>Person2>>So oxygen one, water two. Food three.
156.16:>>Person3>>Water two, and food three.
159.0:>>Person1>>That's not nearly enough water, but you know. (Laughter)
160.75:>>Person3>>Yeah, that's- that's actually not enough. Yeah.
160.77:>>Person4>>(Laughter)
162.1:>>Person1>>It's something.
162.76:>>Person4>>So oxygen one, right?
164.08:>>Person2>>Some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.
166.04:>>Person3>>(Laughter)
167.93:>>Person4>>You guys put water the second right?
169.9:>>Person1>>Yeah.
169.92:>>Person3>>Yes, water second. 
169.94:>>Person2>>Mhm.
171.2:>>Person4>>So another thought process that I put into this, was like because you want to reach the mother ship, and it doesn't say in the scenario that you don't have communication, I thought that the receiver transmitter could be rated a little higher on the list because you need to know where you are going.
187.86:>>Person2>>That was my number four.
189.22:>>Person1>>Yeah, it was six for me, but same idea.
189.35:>>Person4>>Yeah.
191.45:>>Person4>>And that would go along with the constellation map for the moon. 
196.49:>>Person4>>So, what do you guys think about that?
198.46:>>Person2>>I think the radio over the map because, I mean, in whatever situation this is, like, it it's kind of like that cast away thing, where I'd rather have someone to talk to.
202.09:>>Person1>>Yeah.
205.78:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
211.16:>>Person4>>Right. 
211.45:>>Person1>>Mhm.
211.47:>>Person2>>You know so it's like, so I I think the I think the receivers should be-
213.93:>>Person3>>Yeah there's a video game, where it's like, this guy's stranded on a planet, it's a phone game, then you talk to him with it, yeah.
218.6:>>Person2>>Mhm.
221.75:>>Person1>>So four for the radio?
222.09:>>Person2>>Yeah four for radio and then five for map? 
225.61:>>Person4>>Map, yeah.
225.98:>>Person1>>Yeah.
230.67:>>Person2>>%HESITATION Let's see. 
233.15:>>Person1>>I don't think the pistols are terribly useful.
235.89:>>Person2>>They were not- They were not useless, because they're still like a signal, they're still like a means of of like propulsion if you need that.
236.03:>>Person3>>Yeah.
236.24:>>Person1>>(Laughter)
236.3:>>Person4>>Yeah.
242.64:>>Person1>>True. 
244.55:>>Person1>>(Laughter)
244.87:>>Person4>>Yeah.
246.29:>>Person4>>Gravity won't be working either, right? Like not in the way it works here.
249.14:>>Person2>>Yeah, not a ton of it.
249.18:>>Person3>>Well there's a- there's a little bit gravity but not much. 
249.28:>>Person1>>Right, there's some gravity yeah.
252.15:>>Person4>>Yeah, there's less gravity.
254.84:>>Person1>>So I guess you could technically use that as a way to jump and then move. (Laughter).
255.3:>>Person2>>Thirteen- 
258.42:>>Person4>>Yeah. (Laughter)
260.76:>>Person2>>Speed boost.
261.61:>>Person1>>Yeah.
264.06:>>Person2>>Let's think about the milk. I didn't- I thought it was kind of a luxury resource, like-
269.22:>>Person3>>Yeah, yes.
269.39:>>Person1>>Right, because you have to use water for it.
269.47:>>Person4>>Yeah.
270.96:>>Person2>>Right, and you've already got whatever food concentrate is.
274.94:>>Person1>>Right.
275.45:>>Person3>>Yeah.
276.69:>>Person2>>So it's kind of- so- 
278.08:>>Person3>>So twelve?
279.42:>>Person1>>Yeah.
279.48:>>Person2>>Yeah, sure, twelve.
280.52:>>Person3>>Alright.
282.52:>>Person2>>%HESITATION Same thing with the %HESITATION parachute silk, there's no atmosphere, so-
288.89:>>Person3>>Yeah.
290.05:>>Person1>>Well, that's assuming you're using it as a parachute. You can use it for other things of course.
292.11:>>Person2>>As a parachute, that's fair.
295.53:>>Person2>>Like, bedding-
298.18:>>Person2>>True.
298.62:>>Person1>>True, a hammock. 
299.02:>>Person3>>Oh yeah, that's true. That makes sense.
300.04:>>Person2>>A hammock, lunar hammock. 
302.93:>>Person1>>Yeah.
307.39:>>Person2>>%HESITATION So let's see, so what- what is our- what number are we at for the highest? We've got one, two, three, four, five are we deciding on six now?
314.43:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
316.58:>>Person2>>Portable heater?
318.68:>>Person3>>Yeah.
318.8:>>Person1>>Yeah.
319.77:>>Person2>>That's what I thought like-
321.53:>>Person2>>Do you agree with that Shweta?
323.12:>>Person4>>Yeah, like, given your logic it makes sense, so yeah.
325.85:>>Person2>>Okay
327.21:>>Person3>>Also few days trip.
328.87:>>Person4>>Yeah.
329.23:>>Person1>>Yeah.
329.23:>>Person2>>Yeah.
329.58:>>Person3>>Heard it was cold.
330.74:>>Person2>>You know it's- then again, like on all the Apollo missions, they had the space suits, but that was for the front side of the moon. I feel like the dark side of the moon might-
330.91:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
337.7:>>Person4>>Right.
338.36:>>Person1>>That's where there isn't it? Or did they crash on the dark side? 
338.65:>>Person3>>Oh yeah, there's a dark side. 
340.99:>>Person3>>Well they didn't say where, but uh- 
342.34:>>Person2>>Well it's gonna- well that's actually a good point.
342.78:>>Person1>>It says the mother ships on the lighted surface, it doesn't say where we crashed.
348.14:>>Person2>>I'm going to assume that two hundred miles is not enough to be on the other side of the moon, but theoretically-
351.88:>>Person1>>Right, yeah.
352.06:>>Person3>>Yeah. (Laughter)
354.34:>>Person4>>Yeah.
355.5:>>Person2>>We'll take it as as as an insurance policy.
357.92:>>Person1>>Yeah. (Laughter)
358.12:>>Person3>>Yeah.
358.12:>>Person4>>Yeah, we could like consider both, and then, because we are considering both, if it is in the dark it makes complete sense, so yeah. 
359.34:>>Person2>>Okay.
366.27:>>Person2>>There we go.
367.66:>>Person2>>But since it's not assured we wouldn't put it at the top.
369.53:>>Person4>>Yeah.
373.02:>>Person3>>What do we do with the rope? What'd you guys think of the rope?
375.78:>>Person2>>I thought rope was fairly important.
377.62:>>Person1>>You can do a lot of things with rope.
377.94:>>Person4>>Yeah.
379.24:>>Person2>>Tie yourselves together so you don't get lost.
381.3:>>Person3>>Oh yeah, yeah that's true.
381.32:>>Person1>>That's true.
381.36:>>Person4>>Yeah.
384.16:>>Person2>>%HESITATION But I I put that at like eight, I have no problem putting that at like seven.
388.11:>>Person1>>Yeah, somewhere around there.
388.25:>>Person4>>So-
389.2:>>Person2>>Yeah, seven for rope?
390.13:>>Person1>>Yeah.
390.8:>>Person3>>Seven? Okay.
391.44:>>Person4>>Rope, okay.
393.37:>>Person3>>Wait, wait, wait guys, or first aid kit.
396.63:>>Person2>>Those were kind of equal in my mind.
398.61:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah. First aid kit was seven for me. So about the same.
399.25:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
399.88:>>Person4>>Yeah.
402.52:>>Person4>>I put that a little lower at nine, and I've given more preference to the rope and the silk so that you know, tying purposes. So that you don't fly off.
409.57:>>Person3>>Actually, let's do rope, because well first aid kit, like how are you going to get injured?
409.6:>>Person2>>That's fair.
409.84:>>Person1>>Right.
414.57:>>Person2>>I mean that's the thing. What kind of injury on the moon will not result in instant death? You know like-
416.53:>>Person4>>Mhm.
418.9:>>Person3>>Yeah, and yeah-
418.95:>>Person1>>That's true. (Laughter)
419.59:>>Person4>>Plus- plus- plus it should be a stage where it's not instant death, but you had a need for a first aid like band aid or something.
424.05:>>Person2>>Yeah, exactly.
426.23:>>Person1>>Yeah, well and how are you going to administer first aid through a space suit?
429.66:>>Person3>>Yes that's the- yes, exactly.
430.16:>>Person4>>Exactly, like-
430.23:>>Person2>>Exactly like oh, I got a- I got a small paper cut, but my space suit is leaking air so-
434.69:>>Person3>>(Laughter)
435.1:>>Person4>>%HESITATION 
436.44:>>Person1>>Yeah.
436.78:>>Person3>>Alright so seven for rope?
439.52:>>Person2>>Yeah, and then eight for first aid, so at least we can have the morphine?
439.89:>>Person4>>Yeah.
441.57:>>Person3>>Alright.
441.6:>>Person1>>Yeah.
443.05:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
443.86:>>Person3>>Yeah.
447.47:>>Person2>>%HESITATION So the only ones that are left are the signal flare, the parachute, and the pistols.
454.44:>>Person2>>I think signal flare, assuming the signal flare burns. It still makes it really useful.
454.8:>>Person4>>Signal flair.
457.24:>>Person1>>Right. Because why else would you have signal flares in space?
457.84:>>Person3>>Yeah assuming it burns.
461.42:>>Person2>>Why would you have matches?
461.88:>>Person1>>Ri- That's true. (Laughter)
462.32:>>Person3>>Yes. (Laughter)
462.74:>>Person4>>Yeah. (Laughter)
463.23:>>Person2>>(Laughter)
467.37:>>Person3>>Alright, so signal flares. 
467.65:>>Person4>>I think like signal flares should be our next one to go.
471.98:>>Person2>>That sounds good, I agree with that.
472.76:>>Person3>>Yeah, yeah.
472.82:>>Person1>>Yeah, so nine?
474.53:>>Person4>>Nine, yeah.
474.63:>>Person3>>Nine.
475.23:>>Person2>>Nine.
476.95:>>Person2>>%HESITATION Which is just a toss up between guns and parachute. %HESITATION Personally, and this is just- you know- take from this what you will, but if the journey proves impossible, I don't wanna starve to death.
487.26:>>Person4>>Mhm.
488.8:>>Person4>>Yeah.
489.24:>>Person1>>That's true.
490.34:>>Person3>>That- the- okay. 
491.04:>>Person2>>Okay? Rule one of lunar missions, always save a bullet for yourself.
491.91:>>Person1>>So ten?
492.65:>>Person3>>Ten.
495.66:>>Person3>>(Laughter)
497.0:>>Person4>>Cool.
497.79:>>Person2>>And then that leaves parachute at eleven.
497.94:>>Person1>>Then we eleven for parachute. Cool.
499.63:>>Person3>>Eleven, yes, for parachute.
506.07:>>Person2>>Okay, so just to make sure we're all on the same page. Fifteen, three, seven, eleven, six, ten, twelve, one, five, fourteen, thirteen, two, nine, eight, four.
506.62:>>Person3>>Okay.
508.2:>>Person4>>Yeah.
508.38:>>Person3>>Oh yeah.
515.23:>>Person4>>Yes, cool.
515.88:>>Person1>>Yeah.
515.93:>>Person3>>Yes.
516.37:>>Person2>>Cool.
517.52:>>Person2>>Is everybody satisfied?
519.14:>>Person1>>Yeah.
519.63:>>Person4>>Absolutely.
520.07:>>Person2>>Sweet.
