2.652:>>Person4>>So, for one through three I have like oxygen, water, and food. Because that's, like, super important. %HESITATION But I don't know how everyone ranked that. 
9.209:>>Person1>>Yeah, me too. 
14.421:>>Person3>>I didn't put food cause
17.099:>>Person4>>You didn't put it in your top three? 
17.3:>>Person3>>you can, no, cause you can have water and survive. 
18.233:>>Person2>>Same. 
21.564:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
22.233:>>Person4>>Okay. 
23.184:>>Person4>>So what did you have as your number one? 
24.956:>>Person3>>Oxygen, water, and then I had the map as number three. 
30.427:>>Person4>>Okay. 
30.43:>>Person1>>I was confused what the map meant. 
32.069:>>Person3>>I don't know if it's like the map you need, cause like.
33.024:>>Person1>>Yeah, cause it's like, the constellation, I don't know what that, %HESITATION that's why I like I ranked that like twelve, cause I'm like, I don't know what that means. Yeah. 
40.15:>>Person4>>Yeah, I have it ranked as ten. What did you have for your top three? 
42.901:>>Person2>>%HESITATION I have oxygen. And then, for number two, I have solar powered FM receiver. on %HESITATION that's to communicate. 
51.93:>>Person2>>And then number three, I have the compass, cause you need to know where you're going. 
54.873:>>Person4>>Okay. 
55.842:>>Person4>>And then what about water? 
59.142:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
59.16:>>Person1>>I put water as number one but I'd be willing to switch for it's two, for oxygen. I think that makes, I'm like we're not going anywhere if we can't breathe.  
62.22:>>Person4>>Yeah, 
63.547:>>Person4>>yeah, 
65.133:>>Person4>>yeah. 
65.171:>>Person3>>Yeah.
65.523:>>Person2>>I put that as number eight. 
67.414:>>Person4>>You have water as number eight? 
67.474:>>Person2>>Yeah, 
69.561:>>Person4>>Okay. 
70.132:>>Person2>>Because you can survive a certain amount of time without it. 
73.014:>>Person3>>Yeah, but then it's, like, two hundred miles so you would, I think you would need water for two hundred miles. 
73.117:>>Person4>>But not much time.  
75.733:>>Person1>>It's a long way. 
79.318:>>Person2>>I don't know, don't don't those things go pretty fast. 
79.403:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
82.929:>>Person3>>Two hundred miles?
83.036:>>Person2>>I don't know. 
83.100:>>Person3>> In like a car.
87.122:>>Person1>>Two hunderd miles by car would take, like, %HESITATION three and a half hours ish. 
92.63:>>Person2>>You could go three hours without water. 
94.168:>>Person4>>But we're not in a car. We're in a broken rocket ship. 
94.347:>>Person3>>But, yeah, you're walking.
95.489:>>Person2>>You're walking?
97.013:>>Person3>>You're walking in, like, in, like, your space suit and everything. 
102.4:>>Person1>>So do you, I think oxygen is gonna be
104.133:>>Person4>>So I think we can agree on oxygen for number one. 
105.866:>>Person1>>number one, yeah, okay. 
106.216:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
107.064:>>Person4>>Okay. 
112.937:>>Person1>>So also, like I just want to share this, I got to, so I got to, like, seven and I wasn't sure what to do for the middle, so then I started ranking these and it didn't make sense it like, so I. 
120.58:>>Person3>>Yeah, so I started from the bottom
122.297:>>Person1>>Yeah, that's what I, yeah. I was like, %HESITATION there's some things I'm, like, probably don't need that, like. 
126.723:>>Person3>>Yeah, like the pistols? 
127.858:>>Person1>>That's our ranked last, like I'm not sure why we're gonna need that. 
130.133:>>Person4>>Okay, what did you rank the pistol? 
132.112:>>Person3>>Fifteen. 
132.244:>>Person4>>What did you rank?
133.37:>>Person2>>Thirteen. 
134.72:>>Person1>>I did fifteen. 
135.501:>>Person4>>I did fourteen. 
136.394:>>Person1>>Okay. 
137.103:>>Person3>>What did you have as fifteen? 
138.741:>>Person4>>Fifteen? I had a box of matches cause like can't you light, you can't light a fire in space, right?  
145.349:>>Person3>>Oh shoot, there's no oxygen. 
146.201:>>Person4>>Like, it's a vacuum. Yeah, so that's, like, pretty useless. 
148.18:>>Person1>>Oh my god, you're right. You're right. 
151.032:>>Person3>>I was thinking of using the matches for the flares but you're right, like, you can't even. 
151.474:>>Person4>>Like, what are we gonna do with it?  
155.447:>>Person1>>Oh my god, you can't use the matches, if you can't use the flares. 
155.502:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
159.073:>>Person1>>Right? Is that how that works? 
159.14:>>Person4>>Can we? 
160.199:>>Person4>>I don't think you light flares with a match, do you? 
163.019:>>Person1>>Oh god.
163.03:>>Person3>>Or do you just like? 
164.952:>>Person4>>I think you just, like, crack it. 
166.05:>>Person3>>Oh, okay. So, should we have matches as fifteen? 
168.508:>>Person1>>But, do flares still light on fire? 
171.925:>>Person1>>What do flares use? 
172.158:>>Person4>>They just have, like, sparks. 
174.697:>>Person3>>But don't they use oxygen?  
176.602:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
176.602:>>Person4>>True. 
176.613:>>Person1>>%HESITATION Oh gosh. 
184.654:>>Person3>>Let's just try to get to like number.
186.056:>>Person1>>Yeah, let's go back, back to the. 
186.073:>>Person4>>Wait, wait, why would we have 
189.179:>>Person4>>signal flares that require oxygen if we're going to space? Like, wouldn't we have some, like, electrical one, maybe, that, like, has, like, a flashing light? Let's just assume that. 
192.73:>>Person1>>That's so true. 
194.536:>>Person1>>That's true. 
196.231:>>Person3>>Yeah
196.97:>>Person3>>But then why would we have matches
199.382:>>Person4>>Because this is, like, a trick question. 
200.612:>>Person1>>Maybe if we got to the mother ship and there was air in there, we would need matches, somehow. 
205.516:>>Person3>>Okay, yeah. 
207.21:>>Person4>>Alright, should we rank it as fifteen? 
210.145:>>Person1>>Matches? 
210.586:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
213.123:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
213.159:>>Person1>>Yeah, I don't think we need that. 
215.119:>>Person4>>What,
215.18:>>Person3>>What were you thinking for matches?
215.863:>>Person2>>I don't know. 
216.416:>>Person4>>Kat's making a face. 
217.615:>>Person2>>I was thinking for food. 
220.131:>>Person2>>Like
220.356>>Person3>>For food? 
220.188:>>Person2>>Even the whatever ship is broken, %HESITATION I don't know.  
224.678:>>Person3>>But, our thing is, like, there's no oxygen 
227.524:>>Person3>>so we wouldn't be able to use the matches en route anyway. 
227.525:>>Person4>>So how are we gonna like the match? 
232.629:>>Person4>>Because, like, fire needs oxygen. 
235.542:>>Person2>>Okay, okay. Fifteen then. 
236.406:>>Person1>>Alright, so wanna do that? Number fifteen?
238.946:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
239.35:>>Person1>>Okay. 
242.122:>>Person4>>%HESITATION 
242.839:>>Person3>>And I think the parachute silk is also kinda useless. 
246.046:>>Person2>>I mean. 
246.289:>>Person1>>Yeah, I didn't know how, and the like that and the life raft, I'm like, I mean with the moon's kinda, like, 
251.178:>>Person4>>Solid? 
252.334:>>Person1>>I I think so I hope so. 
253.911:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
254.132:>>Person3>>I don't think there's, like, rivers that would require rafts. So.
255.818:>>Person4>>No, there's not.
256.684:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
257.014:>>Person4>>No.
257.863:>>Person2>>I don't know.  
258.625:>>Person4>>So, like the 
261.098:>>Person4>>life raft and the pistols are kind of useless. If we're ranking, like, towards the bottom. 
265.795:>>Person2>>I mean, don't you think? 
266.53:>>Person1>>The only thing I can think of, I'm gonna be completely blunt, if we don't get there in time, everyone's dying, I'd kill myself with the pistol, so, yeah. 
272.942:>>Person2>>I don't know, don't you think that dehydrated milk 
273.433:>>Person1>>I'm not about to, like, starve to death, like, a hundred miles out from this mothership. Just end it, I'm sorry. 
276.557:>>Person2>>is more useless? 
276.778:>>Person4>>Or, like, asphixiate? 
279.816:>>Person3>>I think the, wait but I I'm confused. Like, how would, wouldn't we just, like, float in space if we're, like, walking two hundred miles? 
288.106:>>Person3>>Like, we would just float away?  
290.447:>>Person4>>I don't know. 
290.7:>>Person1>>I I'm hoping that I'm hoping suit we have might keep us down somehow. I have no idea. 
295.524:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
297.309:>>Person4>>But, like, pistols. What would we need pistols for? 
298.143:>>Person3>>Aliens.
301.013:>>Person1>>To actually kill each other. Like
305.386:>>Person3>>I don't know, I don't think we would. 
305.676:>>Person1>>I would rather get, yeah I'd rather take those, though, than the life raft or the parachute silk. 
311.573:>>Person1>>Just because, 
313.131:>>Person1>>desperate measures, I would, yeah. 
315.294:>>Person3>>I feel like silk we could use as like a like a rope or something?
315.682:>>Person4>>I feel like parachute silk seems. 
319.551:>>Person1>>What is that? Is I like the like the 
319.572:>>Person4>>Yeah.  
322.04:>>Person3>>Just like the parachute part, I think. 
322.122:>>Person1>>the stuff you actually? 
322.954:>>Person4>>Like, I I think it's useful just because it's, like, a really strong but, like, thin silk. 
326.628:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
327.514:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
328.858:>>Person4>>Yeah so. 
330.348:>>Person1>>So wanna do %HESITATION the life raft, fourteen? 
335.143:>>Person1>>Cause all we're gonna do, all we're gonna do is carry that, yeah, and it's just gonna like, yeah. 
335.175:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
335.177:>>Person3>>Yeah.
340.201:>>Person3>>Cuz we don't know there's no like big body of water
340.308:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
341.401:>>Person4>>Kat? 
342.574:>>Person4>>Okay, she was just staring at her paper. 
345.182:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
348.79:>>Person3>>Wait, do you guys wanna put water as second? 
351.115:>>Person1>>Yeah, I was just thinking that, it's a good idea. 
351.14:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
356.1:>>Person3>>And I don't know how important the heating unit is cause, like, I know it's, like, cold but I don't know if the suit is, like. 
362.486:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
362.598:>>Person4>>Yeah, I've had heating unit as four. So, like, after oxygen, food, and water. 
369.239:>>Person2>>I had it as eleven. 
370.879:>>Person3>>Yeah, I had it as ten cause.
373.976:>>Person1>>I had the heating unit as nine. I had %HESITATION the receiver as four, 
373.976:>>Person1>>cause I'm like, it'd be nice to know if, like, they at least know we're coming. 
381.452:>>Person3>>Yeah, I didn't even know if the receiver would work, like. 
386.207:>>Person4>>Because it's solar powered? 
388.797:>>Person2>>No, if they give it it probably works. 
388.99:>>Person4>>Like, there's still sun. 
389.042:>>Person3>>But, you're still in. 
392.094:>>Person3>>Is that how it, like, it would work? 
393.43:>>Person2>>I mean, 
393.467:>>Person4>>That's the only way we would be able to communicate because we can't just, like, use a phone.  
395.166:>>Person3>>Okay, yeah. So that should be, like, 
395.388:>>Person2>>so, yeah, but that's 
397.596:>>Person4>>Pretty up there.  
398.335:>>Person3>>yeah, top five. 
398.896:>>Person4>>I actually had it as three. I have food as four. 
401.908:>>Person2>>I had that as second. 
404.432:>>Person4>>Okay, we already filled up one and two, though. So should we put that as three? 
408.267:>>Person1>>Yeah, we can do that.
412.161:>>Person1>>And then maybe food as four.  
414.647:>>Person4>>I think food. 
414.738:>>Person3>>Do we want food concentrate or, like, milk? 
419.412:>>Person4>>Don't say that, don't say milk. 
420.181:>>Person2>>Don't, I put that as fifteen. 
422.113:>>Person4>>No, we really we really don't need milk. 
422.948:>>Person2>>What even is that? 
425.289:>>Person2>>Oh my god. 
425.576:>>Person1>>Yeah, the book I put fourteen. I was like, what? 
429.56:>>Person4>>No. 
431.864:>>Person4>>Okay, so food is four? 
433.041:>>Person1>>Yeah let's do that. 
436.904:>>Person4>>%HESITATION 
439.383:>>Person1>>Hm, what other stuff did I put up there? 
442.591:>>Person4>>I had nylon rope for six just because it seems like it would be useful. But I don't know. 
449.719:>>Person1>>Oh, what about the compass? 
450.477:>>Person2>>Yeah, you need to know where you're going. 
451.604:>>Person1>>Like, if if we heard like, oh, like, this is where we are, we could be like okay, we'll direct it, and then we could start walking that way. 
458.114:>>Person1>>I thought that I was helpful. 
458.327:>>Person4>>I just didn't know if compasses work differently in space. Because you know how it's, like, based on Earth? 
463.26:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
463.272:>>Person4>>Like, the north and south poles? So if we're, like, not even in Earth, how is the compass gonna work? 
467.995:>>Person2>>So the compass or the map. There's a map, right? 
471.697:>>Person3>>And don't you need like
471.74:>>Person1>>Do all planets, or stuff, or moons have a north south pole? 
478.11:>>Person1>>I'd assume,
478.62:>>Person3>>Don't you, like, need gravity for it, though? For compasses? 
481.993:>>Person1>>I don't know, cause
482.103:>>Person4>>No, it's based on, like, the magnetic poles. 
485.018:>>Person1>>I'd assume, though, that they wouldn't give us a compass for nothing. 
488.261:>>Person1>>But then again, they did give us the matches. 
489.86:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
496.237:>>Person1>>Yeah, I think that either we need the map or the compass to know where we're going. Because if we can, if we're talking to them like, hey, like, come find a us. They'd be like, where are you? And we'd be like, that's a good question. 
505.2:>>Person4>>Yeah, yeah maybe if we have, like, a stellar map at least we could kind of say what area we were in.
512.768:>>Person1>>But then again the moon 
512.768:>>Person1>>is very, like, there's not whole lot of, like, things that are going to be very, %HESITATION like, %HESITATION what's the word?
520.088:>>Person1>>Distinct, like if we look at a crater, that one looks the same then we're trapped. 
523.268:>>Person3>>Yeah.
524.472:>>Person4>>Are those a stellar map of the moon's constellation. Because it's, like, describing what 
529.909:>>Person4>>is, like, around the moon? So we could, like, pinpoint where we are and then what we see and then they can, 
535.231:>>Person3>>And where like our destination is
538.351:>>Person4>>yeah.  
538.403:>>Person1>>Does mean like the stars? 
538.403:>>Person1>>Or do like, like
540.488:>>Person4>>I think so, like, what's ar not only the moon but what's around it. Like its constellations. 
549.138:>>Person1>>That one confuses me, because then again everything looks everything looks like a star and everything looks like a crater. 
553.311:>>Person4>>True. 
556.067:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I'm not sure.  
559.044:>>Person3>>Maybe we should put compass before that anyway cause we wouldn't 
564.947:>>Person3>>be able to do anything with the map without a compass. 
567.405:>>Person1>>Yeah, that's true. 
568.929:>>Person3>>So it's still more important than the map. 
575.419:>>Person4>>So are we gonna put compass as five and then map as six? 
577.894:>>Person1>>Yeah, as I think assuming that there is a north and south pole, that would be helpful. 
586.241:>>Person1>>And the map, six?
587.956:>>Person3>>Yes. 
592.096:>>Person4>>And then 
593.864:>>Person4>>the flares we talked about if, like, considering that they were electrical or something that wouldn't require oxygen, should we rank those next? That way if they are somehow, like, using a satellite to, like, look for us, they can see our location more clearly. 
599.409:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
606.629:>>Person1>>Yeah, I think that's a good idea. 
608.434:>>Person4>>Since right now we're thinking about how we're gonna find where are. 
613.082:>>Person4>>So that would be seven. 
615.851:>>Person3>>I think we should have the heating unit next.
619.967:>>Person1>>Yeah, I think that's smart. 
621.073:>>Person3>>Cause,
622.304:>>Person4>>While we're waiting for them, we stay warm. 
623.417:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
625.347:>>Person3>>and, like, we're definitely not gonna do two hundred miles in one you go. 
627.368:>>Person1>>Yeah.
628.815:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
629.755:>>Person1>>That's true. 
632.928:>>Person1>>And I also just realized something about the first aid kit. 
632.928:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I don't know how how we're gonna use that if we're in, like, the suits. 
639.367:>>Person4>>Yeah, and it says containing injection needles. 
639.421:>>Person3>>Yeah.
641.897:>>Person1>>Like what 
642.331:>>Person3>>I didn't think, that was, like, down there, for me. 
642.995:>>Person4>>Like, yeah.
644.991:>>Person1>>yeah. 
645.063:>>Person4>>Yeah, same. I had it as twelve. 
646.78:>>Person1>>I put it is seven, but I'm like, I'm looking at it, I'm like, why did I do that? 
649.358:>>Person4>>Yeah. I mean, should we put that as our lowest number right now, as thirteen? 
654.532:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
654.751:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
659.281:>>Person3>>And do we want to do heating unit as
663.133:>>Person1>>I think eight. 
663.551:>>Person3>>eight? 
668.452:>>Person4>>Okay so we have ropes, silk, pistols, milk. 
668.644:>>Person1>>And milk. 
672.019:>>Person4>>Oh, can we put milk at the end, too? 
672.535:>>Person3>>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
672.607:>>Person1>>I refuse to take that with us.
674.108:>>Person3>>Yeah.
677.119:>>Person4>>Like, I don't even like milk that much. I don't know about you guys. 
679.488:>>Person1>>And it's dehydrated, like, it's powder. 
682.624:>>Person4>>Yeah, so we're gonna need to use our water for that. And, like, we need our water to drink. 
687.419:>>Person3>>I think, next we should do
689.626:>>Person4>>Wait, should be put milk below the first aid kit, though? Becuase milk's definitely, like, more useless. 
693.141:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
694.975:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
696.431:>>Person1>>Than than what? 
697.468:>>Person4>>The first aid kit.  
699.08:>>Person1>>Oh yeah, 
699.126:>>Person4>>Like, if we're gonna put it down there we might as well put it, like, all the way down. 
701.072:>>Person1>>Yep. 
702.343:>>Person1>>That's a good call. 
704.165:>>Person4>>So, milk'll be thirteen. 
704.975:>>Person2>>Milk as thirteen? 
707.958:>>Person4>>And then the first aid kit is twelve. 
714.162:>>Person1>>So what's the most useful out of ropes, silk, and pistol. 
717.596:>>Person4>>I feel like either the silk or rope. 
720.417:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
721.056:>>Person2>>I say the rope. 
722.333:>>Person4>>The rope because it's, like, thicker?  
722.35:>>Person1>>Okay. 
723.706:>>Person3>>But the silk is, like, lighter. 
727.817:>>Person3>>Like, fifty feet of rope? 
727.819:>>Person2>>I mean, what if you need something strong? 
731.155:>>Person1>>Yeah.
730.368:>>Person4>>True. Well parachute I think the reason they put parachute silk is 'cause that's, like, really strong.  
735.937:>>Person4>>Like, you could, like, jump out of a plane with that. 
739.627:>>Person1>>Fifty feet, though, is a lot. They don't say how much they give us for parachute silk. True, it is heavy, you're right. 
740.982:>>Person3>>And it's, like, super heavy. 
743.803:>>Person4>>True. 
744.316:>>Person1>>Oh, nylon. Is that? What kind of nylon?
752.912:>>Person1>>It doesn't really matter to me. 
756.319:>>Person4>>I think 
757.654:>>Person4>>I agree with you, like, with the silk 'cause it's lighter. 
759.003:>>Person3>>And you can like, fold it up.
762.869:>>Person4>>Yeah, like the rope, we already have these heavy suits on and then we're gonna have, like, heavy rope. It's gonna be hard, like, maneuver. 
763.118:>>Person1>>That's true. 
767.046:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
769.374:>>Person1>>True. And also I'm not sure why we'll need fifty feet of it. 
773.781:>>Person1>>That's a lot
775.077:>>Person4>>I mean we, they weren't. 
775.146:>>Person1>>of rope. 
775.693:>>Person3>>It's, like, a lot but, like. 
777.006:>>Person4>>I think they said fifty feet so that we are aware that it's heavy. 
780.658:>>Person4>>'Cause they didn't say how much parachute silk because it's such a light item. It's probably not important. 
780.767:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
782.029:>>Person1>>Yeah, okay, true. 
786.26:>>Person1>>So, what's the next number? Is it nine? 
787.244:>>Person3>>Nine, I think? Yeah.  
792.876:>>Person3>>And then do we want the pistols or the rope first? 
797.426:>>Person4>>Since we are already picked silk as our, like,
801.69:>>Person4>>string, rope, whatever, should do, I mean what need pistols for? Like, seriously, like, aliens? 
804.594:>>Person3>>Yeah, like, do we really need pistols? 
805.548:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
807.385:>>Person4>>Aliens? 
809.121:>>Person1>>%HESITATION do we want to put that the end and then re do the other ones? Or is that to much work? 'Cause it
814.047:>>Person4>>No, we could always move it around, it's not too much work but 
814.21:>>Person1>>Okay. 
817.773:>>Person4>>does anyone have, like, any idea what would you use pistols for? 
823.853:>>Person1>>Also it's gonna do is hurt people. 
825.318:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
827.623:>>Person4>>Okay, so we can move some stuff around. 
829.495:>>Person1>>Okay. 
830.913:>>Person1>>So it,  
830.913:>>Person4>>We're gonna put it as fifteen? 
830.959:>>Person1>>yeah. 
832.043:>>Person3>>Pistols? 
835.593:>>Person3>>You think that's more useless than the box of matches? 
839.536:>>Person2>>Cause that won't even work. 
843.024:>>Person1>>That is true. Because the box of matches really is useless. The life raft is %HESITATION, is like though that's not even, at least with the pistol, like, it'll do something, even if it's not particularly, like.  
852.293:>>Person3>>Yeah, I guess that %HESITATION we could, like, open the door open the door of the
853.17:>>Person4>>We could, like, 
855.113:>>Person4>>shoot a, like, hole in something. 
855.706:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah. 
857.526:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
861.198:>>Person4>>Yeah, yeah.
862.258:>>Person3>>Alright. 
863.642:>>Person4>>Does anyone here actually know how to use one? I don't. 
865.617:>>Person1>>I've been to a gun range.  
866.759:>>Person4>>Oh, okay, cool. Alright. 
867.068:>>Person3>>Oh, cool. 
869.413:>>Person3>>%HESITATION So that's, 
869.813:>>Person1>>Don't worry guys, I got you. 
872.126:>>Person4>>So that's ten. 
873.089:>>Person3>>And then ten and then rope is eleven. 
877.833:>>Person2>>Wait, what is ten? 
879.332:>>Person4>>Ten is the pistol and then eleven is the rope. 
880.446:>>Person2>>Oh. 
885.779:>>Person4>>Is everyone happy with 
886.479:>>Person1>>We did it. 
887.045:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
888.044:>>Person4>>Our conclusion?
