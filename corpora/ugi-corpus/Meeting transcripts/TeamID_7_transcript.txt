2.022:>>Person1>>So what's the most important you think
10.213:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
12.06:>>Person2>>personally I chose the two hundred no two one hundred pound tank of oxygen 
12.06:>>Person2>>cuz I feel like 
18.697:>>Person1>>yeah me too
19.707:>>Person3>>yeah me too 
19.707:>>Person3>>yeah yeah 
20.918:>>Person2>>right so
21.018:>>Person1>>okay so we are already got our first one
22.684:>>Person2>>yup
25.018:>>Person1>>yeah
28.597:>>Person1>>and for the %HESITATION following 
33.817:>>Person1>>third 
35.71:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
36.588:>>Person3>>I choose water as my second %HESITATION
39.985:>>Person2>>I agree yeah so
40.877:>>Person3>>wow
44.446:>>Person1>>on the third one
44.887:>>Person3>>what a coincidence 
48.673:>>Person2>>%HESITATION I chose food concentrate 
50.416:>>Person3>>Oo! yeah same as mine
50.435:>>Person2>>Cool
51.818:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I choose stellar map but %HESITATION yeah I 
56.688:>>Person3>>yeah you can yeah you can explain your idea a little bit
57.05:>>Person2>>yeah 
57.825:>>Person3>>%HESITATION yes 
59.762:>>Person1>>%HESITATION yes because I actually I think there is not much difference between
67.248:>>Person1>>three to five 
67.248:>>Person1>>%HESITATION since we already have enough 
74.509:>>Person1>>%HESITATION but %HESITATION if 
74.509:>>Person1>>but people can live without the 
74.509:>>Person1>>without taking food for three days
81.536:>>Person1>>so I since %HESITATION yeah but actually I I have accept the %HESITATION food concentrate and the
81.735:>>Person2>>right
90.435:>>Person3>>my argument will be if it is like a two hundred miles distance if we can just walk it probably take ten to twenty days I guess 
100.376:>>Person2>>nice spots? no I think it's like two hundred miles from the point so I guess it's somewhere in the space rather than on the surface of the moon 
100.398:>>Person1>>so we have to walk there 
104.707:>>Person3>>we we 
109.371:>>Person3>>mhm
110.992:>>Person3>>oh so we move faster in the space? haha 
111.004:>>Person1>>yes I I I guess 
113.309:>>Person2>>%HESITATION I'm not clear about that
116.568:>>Person3>> haha
116.593:>>Person1>>we still have to take para some kind of 
120.883:>>Person3>>do we have that? I don't know 
121.018:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I'm not sure
121.592:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
124.61:>>Person3>>if we need to take ten to twenty days I need I think food is very important 
124.77:>>Person2>>that's confusing
125.037:>>Person1>>if walk yeah that very
129.918:>>Person1>>yeah
130.281:>>Person1>>okay then we just choose food
130.668:>>Person3>>%HESITATION
130.808:>>Person2>>yup so
133.005:>>Person3>>okay
133.036:>>Person2>>okay the third one is food
133.36:>>Person1>>yeah and yeah 
137.681:>>Person1>>yeah so what's the 
141.088:>>Person1>>next one
142.401:>>Person3>>the thing map is a very important right 
142.401:>>Person3>>this stellar map
144.773:>>Person1>>yeah otherwise we cannot get there 
144.773:>>Person1>>without 
147.333:>>Person3>>mhm I think stellar map is, serves as the same thing as the magnetic compass
152.454:>>Person3>>which 
154.306:>>Person2>>yeah I feel the same way but like for the stellar map I guess %HESITATION since we crashed on somewhere 
154.306:>>Person2>>I assume the mothership will send someone to us so I don't feel like the map is really useful but the magnetic compass %HESITATION hopefully if you use in the moon or in the space and 
154.306:>>Person2>>that's like something that we can use to %HESITATION like find our way back to the ship or something 
162.48:>>Person1>>mhm
166.705:>>Person1>>yes
171.621:>>Person1>>uh huh
175.207:>>Person1>>so I guess
185.965:>>Person1>>so then yes do you know what do you think about the %HESITATION receiver transmitter 
188.571:>>Person2>>or do you think about the 
191.812:>>Person2>>yeah so I chose that the first one is we need to connect to the mothership 
194.311:>>Person1>>okay
194.717:>>Person3>>mhm
198.263:>>Person1>>yeah 
199.802:>>Person3>>yeah I think yeah I think both the stellar uh both the magnetic compass and the solar powered FM receiver transmitter is very important 
204.669:>>Person1>>they should couple right yeah 
204.669:>>Person1>>yeah yeah then we might get %HESITATION stellar map and %HESITATION solar powered FM receiver 
207.394:>>Person2>>yeah 
218.117:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
218.475:>>Person3>>%HESITATION maybe it's a transmitter as four and %HESITATION magnetic compass as five 
222.01:>>Person1>>yes I guess that's receiver transmitter should be %HESITATION more important 
223.558:>>Person2>>I I agree
228.183:>>Person1>>because they can like connect the ground and
230.001:>>Person3>>mhm
231.695:>>Person1>>even without the map we can yeah
233.100:>>Person3>>mhm
234.18:>>Person2>>yeah that's the fourth one I have a different opinion about the fifth one for the fifth one I chose the portable heating unit because I feel like in the space there's not much heat provided in %HESITATION that's also like one vital thing for humans to survive %HESITATION I didn't really choose that as one to four because I feel like food concentrate can also help us like provide some sort of heat so I chose portable heating as five
234.4:>>Person1>>yeah 
240.122:>>Person1>>mhm
243.468:>>Person3>>okay
243.613:>>Person1>>mhm
248.869:>>Person3>>yeah 
249.148:>>Person1>>mhm 
253.664:>>Person3>>
254.059:>>Person1>>okay yeah 
268.838:>>Person3>>no actually I did that at first time
268.879:>>Person1>>okay 
270.518:>>Person2>>oh cool nice
271.622:>>Person3>>as five yeah 
271.622:>>Person3>>okay so we just choose portable heating unit as five 
271.622:>>Person3>>and then comes to the...yes Is that okay? 
277.273:>>Person1>>yeah the compass 
279.869:>>Person1>>yes I think that's okay
281.581:>>Person2>>pretty much yeah
282.167:>>Person1>>so it is the five as heating unit right 
282.167:>>Person1>>and the six is 
288.251:>>Person3>>yeah
288.389:>>Person2>>yup
290.294:>>Person2>>six actually 
291.422:>>Person1>>compass
292.643:>>Person2>>I I sorry about that I chose the signal flares %HESITATION as the sixth one 
299.168:>>Person1>>see %HESITATION what do you think the %HESITATION difference between the transmitter and signal flares oh signals flares is
306.274:>>Person2>>Cause like you can signal like when they know like when they come near or come closer I don't feel like the solar transmitter are gonna serve %HESITATION as much as the signal flares so I feel like like cause we're we're trying to get back to the mother ship and I feel like signal flares 
309.206:>>Person1>>oh 
320.719:>>Person1>>ohh okay
325.437:>>Person1>>mhm
329.241:>>Person1>>okay so the signal flares is working as something it's not %HESITATION it is for communication within the group?
329.735:>>Person2>>helpful I guess 
341.626:>>Person1>>or it is %HESITATION like
341.772:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
345.014:>>Person1>>or I don't know
345.479:>>Person2>>with the mother ship 
347.585:>>Person2>>like if they cause we 
349.212:>>Person2>>crash at one place and if they come and trying to find us I feel like you send a signal flares is gonna like tell them exactly where you guys like where we located 
349.71:>>Person1>>oh 
351.542:>>Person1>>already with the mother ship
364.614:>>Person1>>uh huh
366.463:>>Person1>>yeah %HESITATION yes so it cannot tell the %HESITATION 
366.463:>>Person1>>you all think which is more important the compass compass or the signal flares 
378.102:>>Person1>>I think 
378.124:>>Person3>>I don't know I'm hope for me there is these devices
380.314:>>Person2>>yeah
381.314:>>Person1>>the flares sounds seems like %HESITATION when you cannot communicate you just
390.363:>>Person2>>flash right? yeah that also makes sense 
391.033:>>Person1>>yeah yeah yes as a signal like oh I'm here like that 
398.905:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
398.905:>>Person1>>and the compass is justa  %HESITATION for %HESITATION you looking for direction
398.946:>>Person3>>ohhh 
398.946:>>Person3>>I think maybe 
403.926:>>Person2>>yeah 
405.205:>>Person1>>one active and one passive
405.327:>>Person3>>so are we are we discussing the difference between the flyers and the transmitter or the difference between the flyer and the compass
410.193:>>Person2>>the flares and the com compass
411.805:>>Person1>>compass 
412.255:>>Person3>>okay okay 
413.807:>>Person1>>yes 
414.522:>>Person3>>ohh 
415.245:>>Person1>>so that is one is active and one is passive so one is waiting for others and I think they both we need both
415.245:>>Person1>>that's %HESITATION
415.245:>>Person1>>yeah maybe just a six seven compass flares
418.003:>>Person3>>ohh haha yeah yeah yeah 
418.419:>>Person2>>mm nope
423.607:>>Person3>>yeah definitely the rank
427.597:>>Person3>>mhm
427.946:>>Person2>>yeah 
428.288:>>Person1>>or 
430.995:>>Person3>>yeah maybe 
431.193:>>Person2>>we can put like six to the magnetic compass and seven as the signal flares
434.829:>>Person3>>yeah
436.945:>>Person1>>yeah that's 
441.498:>>Person1>>and then for the following
447.24:>>Person3>>hmm
447.844:>>Person1>>yeah anyone think 
450.143:>>Person2>>the next one
450.493:>>Person3>>oh I think I choose the first aid kit 
450.901:>>Person2>>yes me too
454.346:>>Person3>>yeah 
454.427:>>Person1>>okay yes 
458.05:>>Person1>>yeah I think yeah it is more important now than others 
462.239:>>Person2>>in case someone hurts themselves 
464.184:>>Person1>>yeah anyone think life raft?
468.338:>>Person2>>which one is it? 
469.233:>>Person1>>life raft it's %HESITATION sixth one from the 
474.112:>>Person1>>the bottom 
475.171:>>Person3>>it's like the coat? 
477.314:>>Person1>>actually I'm not very sure about that but the it is I'm not sure that the function is similar to the first aid kit no 
477.546:>>Person2>>me neither
485.097:>>Person2>>I feel like it's for traveling or something like that like a raft transporter yes that's what I assume 
485.068:>>Person3>>no 
486.68:>>Person3>>what 
488.99:>>Person3>>hahaha
488.995:>>Person1>>%HESITATION it's in the water okay yeah yeah I'm actually I'm not sure what what it is
496.743:>>Person1>>yeah 
496.743:>>Person1>>and the and I also I'm not very sure about the %HESITATION caliber pistol 
505.588:>>Person3>>it's a gun hahaha pong pong 
505.722:>>Person2>>yeah it's like pistol gun
508.777:>>Person1>>it's like okay then 
509.454:>>Person3>>gun 
509.493:>>Person2>>for shooting things for people or 
509.493:>>Person2>>not you guys 
512.657:>>Person3>>wow shooting who
512.657:>>Person3>>no people there 
512.689:>>Person1>>can bullet can bullet go very smoothly on in the space?
517.621:>>Person3>>alien
521.7:>>Person2>>I don't know maybe not because the gravity 
523.828:>>Person1>>yeah then that's just not so maybe parachute silk?
525.491:>>Person3>>haha
526.595:>>Person2>>it's gonna float 
530.187:>>Person2>>I feel like it's not useful like 
534.835:>>Person1>>actually I also 
535.647:>>Person2>>oh para parachute is like 
538.867:>>Person2>>jumping like where you jump out of the plane yes 
539.305:>>Person3>>ohh landing for landing
539.308:>>Person1>>but what is silk what is wilk 
544.077:>>Person2>>%HESITATION I guess it's the like the larger part of the parachute like the largest part it it can hold the air and to like lift people up 
552.127:>>Person1>>ohh
554.172:>>Person3>>Ooo 
554.41:>>Person1>>okay at first I thought it might like %HESITATION do a like %HESITATION make your %HESITATION something we are traveling on 
565.690:>>Person2>>oh
565.758:>>Person1>>lower the speed when you reach the I thought it's something like that but I'm not sure so
570.038:>>Person3>>ground 
571.522:>>Person2>>yeah yes pretty much
571.635:>>Person3>>uh huh
575.432:>>Person3>>I don't know 
575.467:>>Person1>>yes 
575.467:>>Person1>>yeah the left the leftover these %HESITATION how many %HESITATION these %HESITATION
575.467:>>Person1>>these seven actually
575.467:>>Person1>>I don't think
585.407:>>Person2>>yeah I don't think the order really matters
587.963:>>Person1>>they are very essential 
590.804:>>Person2>>the less useful thing that I chose is the %HESITATION
593.065:>>Person1>>mhm
596.79:>>Person2>>%HESITATION yeah the the stellar map and the matches 
596.865:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
599.366:>>Person1>>okay I think them yeah I think that matches the least 
603.705:>>Person3>>oh maybe maybe it's a it's a gun it's the pistol 
603.792:>>Person2>>yeah
604.437:>>Person1>>%HESITATION yes so maybe we choose more important one from these seven 
607.298:>>Person2>>that also works
609.591:>>Person3>>I just don't understand
614.582:>>Person2>>%HESITATION yup we can do it
615.851:>>Person1>>mm maybe rope? 
615.851:>>Person1>>rope or %HESITATION 
620.923:>>Person1>>%HESITATION milk?
621.504:>>Person3>>how come you use rope in space? 
622.514:>>Person2>>yeah I I chose milk 
623.716:>>Person1>>not sure 
625.687:>>Person1>>milk yeah I guess milk yeah then milk just the nine
625.861:>>Person2>>yeah dehydrated milk 
626.514:>>Person3>>yeah we can choose milk 
629.924:>>Person2>>yup nice 
632.029:>>Person1>>yeah and %HESITATION 
635.066:>>Person1>>how about the the life raft 
638.959:>>Person1>>the 
641.315:>>Person1>>and the 
641.315:>>Person1>>yeah 
644.464:>>Person3>>the map the food concentrate ah food concentrate already did sorry so it's only the live the raft the map 
646.639:>>Person1>>yeah
651.517:>>Person1>>yes map and the life raft 
651.517:>>Person1>>parachute silk which one is  
651.842:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
652.427:>>Person3>>and the the parachute 
659.663:>>Person3>>me- %HESITATION
662.036:>>Person1>>%HESITATION kind of like %HESITATION life raft parachute silk is similar
669.813:>>Person3>>I think I think probably parachute is important because we don't know how far or how fast we move in space so we reach the speech the speed of us change directly from the space to the ground. Maybe we should use a parachute.
675.828:>>Person2>>yeah that also works
678.571:>>Person1>>are you sure the function is
683.194:>>Person1>>Ohh maybe okay
685.272:>>Person3>>I don't know 
686.688:>>Person3>>Ooo 
688.193:>>then we just set parachute at tenth
689.953:>>Person3>>yes
691.598:>>Person1>>yeah 
692.005:>>Person2>>that works
693.728:>>Person1>>and the 
696.314:>>Person1>>life raft 
697.934:>>Person1>>or map 
698.07:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
699.646:>>Person1>>or rope
699.662:>>Person3>>
701.578:>>Person3>>
701.602:>>Person2>>I guess life raft yeah does that can help us move faster somehow I guess 
705.545:>>Person3>>yeah maybe we can choose that one 
705.913:>>Person1>>yes 
707.987:>>Person1>>yes 
711.265:>>Person1>>yes yes yeah the 
715.348:>>Person2>>the 
716.68:>>Person3>>the map and the matches 
716.684:>>Person2>>the map 
719.202:>>Person1>>%HESITATION raft and rope
719.373:>>Person2>>what do we have left matches rope pistol and the map 
725.387:>>Person1>>yes
726.233:>>Person3>>so we choose map?
728.261:>>Person1>>map yeah maybe map 
728.298:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
731.438:>>Person1>>somehow it might be 
733.182:>>Person2>>I I don't feel like map is useful because like we're landing somewhere else other than the moon 
735.772:>>Person3>>okay 
738.665:>>Person1>>yes of the most  
740.176:>>Person3>>so you prefer rope? 
742.461:>>Person3>>matches? 
742.473:>>Person1>>well 
742.473:>>Person1>>I think rope is more important
742.473:>>Person1>>because without oxygen we cannot light light matches 
742.616:>>Person2>>I I prefer rope 
751.025:>>Person2>>yeah I that's what I think 
752.216:>>Person3>>yeah okay yes 
752.405:>>Person1>>yeah 
753.405:>>Person1>>yeah 
753.959:>>Person3>>smart 
755.518:>>Person3>>so we choose rope? It's fifty feet 
756.518:>>Person3>>so it's quite long right
758.331:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
760.435:>>Person1>>yeah then maybe rope as the twelfth?
760.435:>>Person1>>and %HESITATION map has the  
768.78:>>Person1>>as 
770.838:>>Person1>>yeah 
771.421:>>Person3>>so we will only have matches and pistol right 
774.023:>>Person1>>yeah pistol
774.326:>>Person3>>so maybe we can choose pistol first 
776.546:>>Person1>>pistol okay yeah pistol the thirteenth 
778.739:>>Person3>>in case of alien 
778.739:>>Person3>>yeah 
778.913:>>Person2>>right
781.175:>>Person1>>and %HESITATION matches is the final right okay 
781.91:>>Person3>>matches the last one 
785.641:>>Person3>>nice 
788.167:>>Person2>>cool
788.665:>>Person1>>we're pretty quick 
789.865:>>Person3>>yeah
790.557:>>Person2>>I agree haha
790.679:>>Person1>>to get the final yeah
794.941:>>Person3>>do you want to like %HESITATION clarify the ranking from top to bottom
795.108:>>Person1>>yeah
798.06:>>Person1>>yes sure so the first is fifteenth okay fifteen three twelve ten five thirteen nine one fourteen eleven six two seven eight four 
801.905:>>Person3>>you can just %HESITATION yeah just %HESITATION read
812.337:>>Person2>>oh i missed
824.312:>>Person3>>oh so the stellar map is the last one?824.312:>>Person3>>which one so %HESITATION where is the827.166:>>Person1>>well 
827.166:>>Person1>>matches is the last one
827.182:>>Person2>>the matches is the last one 
829.658:>>Person3>>okay so the stellar map is
832.692:>>Person1>>stellar map is fourteen 
832.846:>>Person2>>fourteen 
834.571:>>Person3>>okay it's fine
836.215:>>Person1>>okay 
842.243:>>Person2>>alright we're done 
842.467:>>Person1>>yeah I guess we finished 
844.896:>>Person2>>yup
846.49:>>Person1>>yeah nice
