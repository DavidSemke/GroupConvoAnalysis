2.5:>>Person3>>So. 
3.79:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
4.1:>>Person2>>So everything for the most important. 
6.16:>>Person3>>Most important.
7.17:>>Person4>>Oxygen?
7.86:>>Person1>>I chose oxygen.
8.55:>>Person4>>Okay, so we can agree on this.
9.53:>>Person3>>I chose the transit-, transceiver and trans- receiver and transmitter.
9.86:>>Person2>>Oxygen?
13.97:>>Person2>>Okay.
14.06:>>Person4>>For the most important one?
16.3:>>Person3>>Well, yeah. 
18.09:>>Person1>>Yeah, okay so my idea is that survival is the most important thing before I- %HESITATION we tried to contact other or, so yeah.
22.77:>>Person3>>Yeah.
33.01:>>Person3>>Okay, I mean I can see definitely where oxygen comes from and so-
36.2:>>Person1>>What's your ranking for oxygen?
38.59:>>Person3>>I kept like the top five were all really close to me so I kept oxygen in the top five.
41.92:>>Person2>>Okay.
44.96:>>Person1>>Yeah.
45.22:>>Person3>>So %HESITATION I kept like food, water and oxygen all in the top five.
50.22:>>Person1>>Yeah, me too. 
50.61:>>Person2>>Yeah, yeah. 
52.69:>>Person1>>The receiver is the fourth ranking for for mine. 
52.96:>>Person4>>Mhm.
55.13:>>Person3>>Yeah.
58.37:>>Person3>>And then I also had the compass up there, too.
58.45:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
61.01:>>Person4>>So we can agree on the first to be oxygen, or?
61.09:>>Person1>>So if-
64.13:>>Person3>>Yeah, no, I agree.
64.26:>>Person1>>Is that okay?
66.01:>>Person2>>Okay.
66.53:>>Person4>>Okay.
68.43:>>Person3>>That definitely makes sense.
71.7:>>Person2>>So were all our top five like water, food, and transistor, or transmitter? 
76.68:>>Person3>>The transmitter.
77.76:>>Person1>>Yeah water, food, transmitter, okay, let me find my
78.13:>>Person4>>Transmitter, not transistors.
83.58:>>Person3>>So, alright-
84.4:>>Person4>>Second one, I put on water, because I thought survival was the most important thing.
84.98:>>Person1>>What's the other? 
86.26:>>Person3>>Yeah.
89.54:>>Person3>>Yeah.
89.97:>>Person1>>Breathe first, water second, and then food.
92.0:>>Person3>>Yeah, yeah, alright, so water's number two and then food is number three, the food concentrate?
92.1:>>Person4>>And the food, yeah. And a cell phone maybe.
92.56:>>Person2>>Yeah, yeah.
93.12:>>Person1>>Yeah, exactly.
98.19:>>Person1>>Yeah, yeah the food concentrate.
99.74:>>Person3>>Alright.
101.51:>>Person1>>I don't understand the milk.
103.91:>>Person3>>See, I feel like the milk is just a waste of resources because it's dehydrated so you'd have, you'd need water to make it, yeah.
106.55:>>Person1>>Yeah.
108.84:>>Person2>>So you'd need water to actually use it.
111.62:>>Person1>>Yeah.
113.86:>>Person1>>So-
116.25:>>Person3>>Okay.
116.44:>>Person4>>So food concentrate, or milk, we just need one of those.
120.07:>>Person3>>Yeah I mean I I ranked milk pretty low, and kept food concentrate at number three. Yeah.
124.92:>>Person1>>Yeah, me too.
126.6:>>Person2>>I'd actually argue on putting the transmitter up a little higher, because even if we do have like the means to survive for awhile we're not gonna do anything about it.
137.25:>>Person3>>Well, I feel like-
137.3:>>Person2>>But I mean if we're all, I mean it's all like the same sort of priority.
141.79:>>Person3>>Yeah-
142.93:>>Person3>>I feel like after oxygen, water, and food then like communication and actually getting a plan together to move around would definitely be the next biggest priority.
151.02:>>Person1>>Yeah, that's my thought too.
152.5:>>Person4>>I put the heating unit up as well because it's gonna get really cold on the moon, for survival purposes.
156.94:>>Person3>>That's true.
157.16:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
158.62:>>Person1>>I put that as, not in the first five, but in the first ten.
163.2:>>Person3>>Yeah.
165.07:>>Person1>>But, yeah, another thing I think is very important is the first aid kit.
171.21:>>Person4>>The first aid kit you can't really use it like outside of a space craft. You can't get out of your suit, right?
174.19:>>Person1>>Really?
177.08:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
177.9:>>Person1>>Oh, that makes sense I didn't think of that. 
177.91:>>Person3>>Yeah.
180.28:>>Person3>>Yeah, that's true, that's why we ranked the matches and flares pretty low too, because there's no oxygen.
184.36:>>Person4>>Yeah I-
184.73:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
185.59:>>Person1>>Yeah there no, there's no there's no oxygen, and it's just consuming our oxygen tanks.
187.29:>>Person4>>I put matches *HESITATION*
190.98:>>Person3>>The life raft is also kind of useless, because there's- 
194.94:>>Person4>>I put- 
195.36:>>Person2>>Magnetic compass is pretty useless.
197.15:>>Person4>>Also-
197.28:>>Person3>>Magnetic compass, not really.
197.41:>>Person1>>No. 
198.95:>>Person4>>No, there's no magnetic field on the moon. No there's probably not, because the core is not molten.
199.45:>>Person2>>There's not a magnetic field on the moon.
199.49:>>Person1>>Is there, there's no magnetic field, right?
199.5:>>Person3>>There's there's there isn't? 
203.14:>>Person3>>Oh okay.
206.37:>>Person3>>Oh okay.
207.36:>>Person4>>%HESITATION Also I put the pistol for the last one fifteen. 
210.42:>>Person2>>Yeah. (Laughter) 
211.27:>>Person3>>Yeah, I kept the pistol pretty low too.
211.99:>>Person4>>Can we agree that's the last one we need? Okay, so just put fifteen on this.
213.37:>>Person1>>(Laughter)
214.52:>>Person2>>Yeah.
215.62:>>Person3>>Alright.
216.94:>>Person3>>Fifteen for the pistol, sure.
217.66:>>Person4>>Yeah.
224.5:>>Person3>>Uhh.
224.56:>>Person4>>*HESITATION* Okay.
225.93:>>Person2>>So what are we going with- fourteen?
226.54:>>Person3>>Magnetic compass is-
229.41:>>Person1>>So for fourteen, I think matches or- 
233.32:>>Person3>>Yeah, matches- matches and the signal flare. 
237.07:>>Person3>>Because.
237.15:>>Person2>>Yeah, I'm assuming signal flares can't work in a vacuum, right?
239.8:>>Person3>>Yeah.
240.25:>>Person4>>They probably cannot.
242.1:>>Person4>>I don't know it depends-
242.15:>>Person3>>Because it-
242.55:>>Person1>>Oh, signal flares use oxygen?
244.36:>>Person3>>Well yeah they're they're using fire too.
244.47:>>Person4>>It depends on their composition
247.37:>>Person4>>If they're using like %HESITATION phosphorous or something.
251.94:>>Person3>>Yeah, they can't burn.
253.95:>>Person3>>Alright.
254.45:>>Person1>>So they're same level.
255.12:>>Person3>>So, matches and signal flare, thirteen fourteen?
259.45:>>Person1>>Okay. Yeah.
259.53:>>Person2>>Okay.
260.09:>>Person3>>Yeah?
261.5:>>Person3>>Alright.
262.18:>>Person2>>Matches, thirteen?
263.39:>>Person4>>%HESITATION Matches fourteen I think.
265.39:>>Person3>>I just- I had matches fourteen originally so I'm just putting it as fourteen and then signal flare, thirteen.
267.6:>>Person2>>Okay.
272.39:>>Person4>>There pretty much equally useless.
278.56:>>Person2>>Compass twelve? 
278.64:>>Person1>>Yeah.
280.41:>>Person3>>Magnetic compass.
282.37:>>Person1>>Maps and compass. Without compass, the map, the stellar map is pretty much useless, too, I think.
290.1:>>Person3>>I feel like the stellar map might be better because you can still, you can still navigate based on what you see above you.
293.69:>>Person1>>See the-
293.7:>>Person2>>I think, yeah.
296.73:>>Person1>>Oh.
298.46:>>Person4>>Yes, because it is based on the moon %HESITATION constellation, so. 
298.92:>>Person3>>Yeah, in in your sky, so.
299.25:>>Person2>>Yeah- 
300.38:>>Person1>>Okay 
303.82:>>Person3>>Yeah, so it's not, yeah.
304.36:>>Person2>>Yeah.
305.81:>>Person4>>It's not very useless. But- I would put that after survival and communication.
306.72:>>Person1>>Oh. 
311.32:>>Person3>>Yeah, so for the receiver where do we want to rank that? 
311.75:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
315.81:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
319.01:>>Person1>>Four? 
319.51:>>Person3>>Do we want to keep-
319.66:>>Person2>>I don't know I feel like-
321.32:>>Person4>>The-
321.81:>>Person1>>Is there-
321.92:>>Person2>>Is there anything else that we need to do for survival?
324.15:>>Person1>>Yeah.
324.9:>>Person4>>Maybe heating, I'm not sure if their suit have heating or not.
327.92:>>Person2>>That's a, that's a good point. %HESITATION 
328.85:>>Person3>>Yeah.
329.77:>>Person1>>I put I put heating as the seventh.
334.51:>>Person2>>I put heating as eleventh but I could be argued up higher, I don't really know how necessary it is.
336.9:>>Person3>>Yeah.
338.64:>>Person1>>Yeah because from from six to eleven they are pretty much the same level of importance.
343.8:>>Person3>>Yeah, I- I put heating as eight. I felt like-
350.25:>>Person3>>Can I ask a question about the nature of the parachute silk? Like what is is %HESITATION or do we just have like strands of silk or is it like a fabric itself?
352.26:>>Person1>>(Laughter)
360.44:>>Person2>>(Laughter)
362.89:>>Person3>>Alright, cool.
363.56:>>Person1>>I I I never thought about how we should use that on the moon there's no like-
363.74:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
365.02:>>Person3>>Alright.
369.29:>>Person3>>I've- 
370.64:>>Person3>>I mean, it could be used as like blanket maybe to keep you warm, yeah.
375.29:>>Person4>>%HESITATION Not really, but okay.
375.43:>>Person1>>Oh. But heating device is also a way to do that.
380.09:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
381.55:>>Person3>>I mean the moon also has like a pretty rough terrain as well so maybe the nylon rope is pretty useful too.
389.12:>>Person1>>Yeah.
389.47:>>Person3>>For climbing, for tying, for anything.
389.71:>>Person4>>Mhm, so-
391.72:>>Person1>>But what about the rope compared to the transmitter?
397.05:>>Person2>>I think transmitter takes priority.
397.54:>>Person4>>Transmitter goes first.
398.08:>>Person3>>Yeah, transmitter takes preference. 
399.71:>>Person2>>So can we agree on that on four?
399.87:>>Person1>>So four for yeah I I think four for transmitter. 
400.29:>>Person3>>Yeah, alright.
400.3:>>Person4>>We can't- we can't take action before we know what's going on.
405.19:>>Person1>>Yeah, that's- 
405.36:>>Person3>>Yeah.
405.4:>>Person4>>So, put transmitter as four and then- 
407.35:>>Person3>>Heater's five?
408.2:>>Person4>>Heater as five? Alright. 
409.54:>>Person3>>I'd be fine with heater being five. 
413.63:>>Person2>>I still don't know how, I don't know.
414.36:>>Person4>>I had five originally, so.
415.08:>>Person1>>Well under what conditions would we have to use heating device?
420.62:>>Person3>>I mean-
422.05:>>Person4>>Pretty much all the time.
423.06:>>Person3>>Yeah.
424.29:>>Person3>>I'd imagine that- there's like not much heat given off on the moon especially at night, so if you have the heating device.
431.9:>>Person4>>Oh, no you're- you're you're on the %HESITATION we're on the illuminated surface I think, lighted surface, yes.
431.91:>>Person1>>Okay.
432.37:>>Person2>>But we're not on it at night.
435.34:>>Person3>>Oh.
439.84:>>Person4>>So it's going to constantly be illuminated by the reflection of of-
442.34:>>Person3>>Oh okay.
442.94:>>Person2>>Sunlit, yeah.
443.77:>>Person3>>Lighted surface.
447.24:>>Person3>>Well I mean how much heat does the moon usually get? 
450.65:>>Person2>>I'm not, I'm just like, yeah-
451.34:>>Person3>>Like, like yeah, if none of us know, then it might be better to be safe than sorry to keep heat with us.
452.96:>>Person1>>We need more information.
457.1:>>Person3>>Because, next thing you know, like, even if- even if our suits keep us warm but it's cold enough for the water to freeze, you don't want that happening.
460.06:>>Person2>>We don't-
463.98:>>Person2>>Yeah.
465.23:>>Person1>>Yeah. (Laughter)
466.06:>>Person3>>So-
467.49:>>Person4>>Okay, so we put that on five.
468.84:>>Person3>>Yeah, yeah.
468.85:>>Person1>>Okay, okay. 
469.2:>>Person2>>Okay.
471.91:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
474.52:>>Person1>>So rope, parachute, life raft, first aid- oh yeah.
477.18:>>Person3>>First aid kit might.
480.92:>>Person4>>Now we get in the hard part, because there-
481.25:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
484.35:>>Person2>>Yeah.
487.69:>>Person4>>Can we say life raft, we don't need that?
490.82:>>Person3>>Yeah, I don't see the point of the life raft either.
490.92:>>Person1>>Life raft.
493.36:>>Person1>>No, me neither. 
494.8:>>Person2>>I feel like you could, no, I don't know.
497.63:>>Person4>>You could use that as a slide, maybe go down like this, but you could use parachute silk as well.
499.22:>>Person2>>As-
504.45:>>Person3>>I feel like it might be more dangerous using parachute silk to like slide down things than it might just be to get in a raft and- 
504.52:>>Person2>>I feel you could-
512.18:>>Person2>>I feel like theoretically, you could almost use the life raft as like a sort of trolley to carry all the stuff along in, but I don't know.
517.61:>>Person4>>Oh, that's a good point. 
518.71:>>Person1>>Oh, yeah. 
520.58:>>Person2>>In combination with the rope, but I don't really know how.
524.14:>>Person3>>So, alright.
526.42:>>Person4>>Won't the life raft just explode because it's pretty much a vacuum and if you have like a little air in it it's just gonna expand?
533.6:>>Person3>>Alright, stellar map. Can we make stellar map six?
537.05:>>Person3>>Because for for navigation? Yeah okay.
537.41:>>Person1>>Yes I think, okay, yeah, that makes sense.
537.57:>>Person2>>Ok, yeah that's fair.
542.01:>>Person4>>Let me see if there is anything more important. I don't think so.
544.85:>>Person2>>%HESITATION What do we, want are our thoughts on the first aid kit?
549.02:>>Person2>>Oh yeah, we can't we can't do anything about it because we can't take off our suits. So should that be like twelve?
550.56:>>Person3>>Yeah.
554.76:>>Person4>>I didn't think of that when I ranked it for myself, so.
557.57:>>Person3>>Yeah.
560.23:>>Person4>>Six, so, first aid kit, twelve.
566.96:>>Person2>>Is it the least important of what we have left?
567.98:>>Person1>>Wait, first aid kit, is that that low? Lower than dehydrated milk and magnetic compass?
574.5:>>Person4>>Is we- oh.
575.86:>>Person3>>I feel like in in the worst case scenario, if you like let's say run out of food and you need nutrition, you could use the milk, but in the first aid kit, you can't really take off your suit.
581.19:>>Person2>>You could use milk.
589.14:>>Person1>>But what if someone got seriously injured?
592.29:>>Person4>>Then they're done.
594.26:>>Person3>>I mean-
594.81:>>Person4>>Like, you can't really save them.
595.28:>>Person2>>Although, how are you going to eat the food, anyway? 
597.91:>>Person4>>If you get seriously injured you actually probably have a puncture in your suit.
602.18:>>Person1>>Food concentrate.
604.32:>>Person1>>I think it's just food in your mouth and you're fine.
608.86:>>Person4>>What?
610.61:>>Person1>>I don't know.
610.83:>>Person3>>I mean I imagine you-
612.69:>>Person2>>Alright, let's assume there's some way to like eat the food and stuff.
613.24:>>Person3>>Yeah, eat the food. Okay.  Just gonna make this a possible dilemma to have, like okay.
621.65:>>Person4>>There should be, otherwise the oxygen would be useless.
623.97:>>Person3>>Yeah %HESITATION
627.51:>>Person3>>Alright, so.
629.48:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
630.95:>>Person3>>So we know that life raft, %HESITATION nylon rope, parachute silk, and dehydrated milk, rank above the usefulness of the magnetic compass.
642.47:>>Person4>>I can agree on that.
644.25:>>Person3>>What?
644.96:>>Person4>>I mean, I can agree on that.
645.78:>>Person3>>Yeah, the magnetic compass, but what about the first aid kit? So magnetic compass would probably go in twelfth?
653.24:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
653.39:>>Person2>>I'm thinking twelfth.
654.62:>>Person4>>Oh okay.
654.62:>>Person1>>Okay.
654.9:>>Person2>>I think it's the least important of what we have left.
655.88:>>Person3>>The- yeah, yeah.
656.76:>>Person1>>Okay, yeah I put that as thirteen originally so twelve's fine. 
657.59:>>Person4>>So we are not ranking the first aid kit?
662.64:>>Person4>>Okay. 
663.0:>>Person3>>Alright.
664.52:>>Person3>>So now, we have the nylon rope, parachute silk, the life raft and the first aid kit.
664.74:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
671.12:>>Person1>>The rope.
674.3:>>Person3>>So we don't know the nature of the parachute silk, so I think-
678.5:>>Person1>>We have only five left and the mail, yeah.
681.06:>>Person3>>Yeah.
681.28:>>Person4>>So can anyone think of any use for parachute silk?
684.43:>>Person3>>Well, we don't know if it's just like loose fabric or if it's if it's just strands of the like longer thinner strands of silk or corded what. We don't know what.
684.58:>>Person2>>Parachutes. (Laughter)
686.81:>>Person4>>Parach- there's, there's- 
691.29:>>Person2>>Yeah. %HESITATION 
693.57:>>Person4>>So we rank it below the ropes. 
697.58:>>Person3>>Okay yeah that's fine. 
697.74:>>Person1>>Yeah.
699.35:>>Person2>>Okay.
701.17:>>Person4>>%HESITATION 
701.28:>>Person1>>So, okay, so so parachute below the rope. 
703.68:>>Person4>>So we have it-
703.74:>>Person2>>So silk versus first aid kit. Which is less important?
708.24:>>Person1>>First aid kit. 
712.65:>>Person2>>Or here's a better question, do they rank above dehydrated milk?
716.3:>>Person1>>Yeah.
717.65:>>Person4>>How many miles? Two hundred miles?
720.2:>>Person3>>See like I keep flip flopping on the first aid kit, just because if you can- if we can assume that you can eat food, we can assume that you can get an injection. Like I feel like that would probably work the same way. Now that we've now that we've gotten that the ground that food is possible to eat, then maybe the first aid kit would also be possible to use.
727.54:>>Person2>>Yeah, yeah. 
737.69:>>Person2>>(Laughter) Yeah. 
739.78:>>Person1>>Yeah, okay.
742.79:>>Person1>>Yeah, and what I'm thinking is that now that we have food concentrate, we don't really need the dehydrated milk, and the first aid kid could cover another possible condition that if someone got injured or got sick.
748.89:>>Person3>>Yeah.
758.8:>>Person3>>So do we want to rate or rank the first aid kit as number seven?
763.7:>>Person4>>I have no problem with that.
764.88:>>Person2>>Okay, yeah.
765.25:>>Person1>>Yeah I'm okay with that, I really like that.
765.89:>>Person3>>Okay.
768.74:>>Person4>>Now that- we can use it.
770.27:>>Person1>>Now down to four.
771.08:>>Person2>>I feel like we should toss in the rope in pretty soon, though.
773.52:>>Person3>>Yeah, okay so then-
775.46:>>Person4>>Rope goes down eight?
777.02:>>Person3>>Rope, yeah I'm fine with rope being eight.
778.98:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
779.09:>>Person2>>Alright. 
779.72:>>Person3>>Alright?
782.2:>>Person3>>And now all we have left is dehydrated milk, parachute silk and life raft.
782.46:>>Person4>>Alright.
782.63:>>Person1>>So para-
790.43:>>Person4>>Life raft goes before silk?
792.67:>>Person3>>Yeah I would I would say so, just because we can use the life raft for carrying items or like going down slopes or whatever we need to.
794.23:>>Person2>>Okay.
798.22:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
800.18:>>Person1>>Yeah, like Josh said before.
800.46:>>Person4>>Or we can tear it apart, for it's fabric as well.
802.91:>>Person3>>Exactly. 
805.02:>>Person3>>Yeah, the life raft might be more useful.
807.41:>>Person2>>Silk last?
807.55:>>Person1>>So that's nine?
809.39:>>Person3>>%HESITATION Seven, eight, yeah make life raft nine.
811.88:>>Person1>>That's that's nine, yeah.
815.99:>>Person3>>So then we just have-
816.08:>>Person1>>Now milk and parachute silk. (Laughter)
818.52:>>Person4>>Okay, that's the-
821.11:>>Person4>>That's the hardest question.
822.87:>>Person3>>Okay.
824.25:>>Person3>>Parachute silk's weird just because we don't know what it's like, and dehydrated milk just sounds like a waste of resources because you'd have to use water to make the milk.
826.86:>>Person2>>Yeah.
829.66:>>Person1>>(Laughter)
831.75:>>Person1>>Yeah.
832.65:>>Person4>>Choosing bad from bad.
833.66:>>Person3>>%HESITATION I mean it's not like you're getting any less liquid 
837.7:>>Person4>>It's just *HESITATION* it's not really useful without any water.
838.41:>>Person3>>It's-
840.89:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
841.34:>>Person2>>Yeah.
842.42:>>Person3>>I mean-
844.08:>>Person1>>Is there any condition we can think of that we must use one of them?
844.2:>>Person2>>Sacrificing one resource.
848.46:>>Person4>>We don't have much, we only have five gallons of water. That's not going to last like, say, five days.
854.01:>>Person2>>I feel like I'd rather take a gamble on whatever parachute silk is, than with dehydrated milk.
859.54:>>Person3>>Well let's think about it this way. If we have five gallons of water, and we have food concentrate and then we also have dehydrated milk. If we have water that we can turn into dehydrated milk without wasting any of the water, right, by just rehydrating it to make a new type of liquid, we also the nutrition of the dehydrated milk.
884.54:>>Person4>>It- It's the same-
884.79:>>Person3>>Granted it's not that much.
886.23:>>Person4>>It's the same thing with the food concentrate.
889.28:>>Person4>>Just *HESITATION*, we have how- there are four persons, there are five gallons of water. How long do we think it's going to last?
890.57:>>Person1>>Wait does-
895.84:>>Person3>>I mean hopefully last long enough to let us move two hundred miles but-
897.89:>>Person4>>Like, one week tops, I think?
