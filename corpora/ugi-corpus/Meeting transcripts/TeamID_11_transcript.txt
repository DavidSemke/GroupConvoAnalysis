3.09:>>Person1>>so 
4.962:>>Person3>>so what was the most important item that you guys put
8.396:>>Person2>>
9.713:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
9.713:>>Person2>>so I said I said like the two hundred pounds tanks of oxygen like that that what I 
13.974:>>Person1>>yeah that's what I said okay well 
14.221:>>Person3>>I said I said the same thing so we could put that
18.462:>>Person3>>it's important to breath
19.216:>>Person1>>
20.907:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
21.152:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
22.43:>>Person2>>I said water 
24.079:>>Person1>>yeah I did too
24.23:>>Person3>>same
24.336:>>Person2>>great
29.536:>>Person3>>third I said food
29.709:>>Person1>>yeah 
31.04:>>Person2>>I said first aid kit okay yeah I'm not sure
32.812:>>Person1>>okay  
33.379:>>Person3>>yeah my 
34.957:>>Person3>>first aid kit was high up there too for me
36.771:>>Person1>>I put well I meant to put it higher up and I think I messed up but like I would agree I think that it would be maybe more important though because it's possible that we'll get hurt but like we need to eat so 
41.11:>>Person3>>haha
49.854:>>Person3>>yeah 
50.598:>>Person2>>yeah okay 
52.011:>>Person3>>so we can put that as third
52.881:>>Person2>>yeah 
56.698:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
57.152:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
58.822:>>Person3>>yeah I can see how the first aid kit could go next
58.991:>>Person2>>
62.463:>>Person1>>I could too
63.976:>>Person2>>right yeah
65.267:>>Person1>>yeah 
65.407:>>Person3>>if a person gets hurt
68.067:>>Person2>>
73.36:>>Person1>>let's see like the like the dehydrated milk might be important 
79.261:>>Person1>>just because like more food or maybe like the stellar map I don't know
85.214:>>Person3>>yeah I put the stellar map as fourth and then the magnetic compass as fifth because those go hand in hand
88.4:>>Person1>>yeah me too 
91.959:>>Person3>>because the mission is to like find the other ship right or the other whatever it is
92.27:>>Person2>>yeah
95.599:>>Person1>>yeah 
97.608:>>Person2>>so the map of the area would would be fifth I think
101.724:>>Person1>>yeah I would 'cause yeah I had it is fourth as well
101.753:>>Person2>>yeah okay 
104.989:>>Person3>>yeah 
106.211:>>Person3>>we can do that as fifth
106.411:>>Person1>>wanna put that as fifth?
108.081:>>Person3>>mhm
111.676:>>Person2>>I said the %HESITATION the compass yeah 'cause
111.684:>>Person1>>%HESITATION and then did you yeah did you wanna do the compass as six then just so we can use them 
116.24:>>Person3>>yeah 'cause those go hand in hand
121.736:>>Person1>>okay
122.819:>>Person3>>alright what do we have left
125.538:>>Person1>>so I have
125.654:>>Person2>>yeah
127.547:>>Person2>>mhm
127.568:>>Person1>>heating unit 
129.679:>>Person1>>pretty high up 
129.687:>>Person2>>
130.956:>>Person3>>yeah in case people get if it gets cold like hypothermia right 
133.668:>>Person1>>yeah 
135.323:>>Person1>>because that can also like be death so if we're doing first aid kit so high I feel like that might be also important 
142.058:>>Person3>>yeah I agree with that
145.451:>>Person3>>like dehydrated milk is important too but like we already have the food concentrate 
145.664:>>Person2>>yeah yeah 
145.991:>>Person1>>yeah 
150.292:>>Person1>>yeah
150.749:>>Person3>>so we can put the milk later on 
152.927:>>Person1>>okay 
155.016:>>Person1>>so 
155.016:>>Person1>>do we wanna do heating unit or is there something else that like might be more important 
160.807:>>Person1>>signal flares maybe 
160.949:>>Person2>>or like the yeah
162.744:>>Person3>>I said the solar power FM receiver transmitter because that's like a communication right if there's like a signal so say you're like absolutely like lost you could like reach out maybe 
163.027:>>Person1>>oh I had that up too
167.412:>>Person1>>yeah 
172.276:>>Person1>>yeah 
175.435:>>Person1>>solar powered because we're on the light side of the moon right so we can use the solar powered FM receiver 
180.208:>>Person3>>yeah yeah yeah 
182.32:>>Person2>>okay yeah so I mean that yeah seven
183.821:>>Person3>>you wanna put that as seven?
184.061:>>Person1>>wanna put that as seven
189.154:>>Person2>>and the signal flares I guess for for eight
191.654:>>Person1>>after that 
195.565:>>Person1>>%HESITATION 
195.639:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
199.198:>>Person1>>what's more important heating unit or signal flares
203.907:>>Person3>>yeah if it gets like really cold that could be an issue 
205.739:>>Person1>>'cause
207.562:>>Person1>>I feel like that's like a big thing it's like it's like part of like shelter which you need to survive 
214.195:>>Person3>>yeah because you might not run into like people and not might not need the signal flares until like later on 
217.766:>>Person2>>yeah okay
220.199:>>Person1>>and if we have the like the transmitter then
223.426:>>Person3>>yeah that's like form of communication too 
227.129:>>Person1>>so heating unit as eighth? 
227.217:>>Person2>>sure yeah 
230.592:>>Person1>>does that does that sound like a good idea to you 
233.592:>>Person2>>%HESITATION %HESITATION I mean I I don't really see like what what else is more important yeah
235.88:>>Person1>>okay yeah 
236.102:>>Person3>>yeah they're kind of like the same level so we could put the heating unit as eight
243.998:>>Person1>>%HESITATION and then 
246.733:>>Person1>>do we need anything else more than the signal flares or do you want to put signal flares
251.485:>>Person1>>after that 
254.785:>>Person3>>what could we use like the rope for 
254.945:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
257.185:>>Person1>>that's what I was thinking like it could come in handy but I'm not sure exactly for 
263.798:>>Person1>>what 
265.104:>>Person3>>right 
265.671:>>Person1>>because I know like I mean 
272.704:>>Person1>>like it like that seems like something extremely useful like fifty feet of rope but 
276.1:>>Person3>>yeah maybe we can use it like with the parachute 
279.583:>>Person3>>like use it together I don't know but then when would you use a parachute I don't know 
281.74:>>Person1>>yeah I'm not really sure 
285.91:>>Person1>>haven't been to space before I'm not really sure
286.087:>>Person2>>haha yeah haha
286.511:>>Person3>>haha
290.184:>>Person1>>I put those pretty low because I just didn't know like I felt like a lot of the other other also like a life raft I felt like a lot of the other stuff was way more important
290.308:>>Person3>>same
297.873:>>Person3>>yeah like a life I don't think there's water 
300.937:>>Person3>>but like would you need a life raft?
301.089:>>Person2>>should that yeah I don't know for I don't know haha yeah %HESITATION okay yeah
304.368:>>Person1>>not that I can think of like unless you wanted to be like tie a rope to the life raft if someone gets tired like I don't know yeah
304.43:>>Person3>>yeah just like drag them I say signal flares should be next
313.725:>>Person1>>okay I would agree with that
316.105:>>Person3>>and then obviously you have to light them so then the matches would go with that for ten 
316.246:>>Person1>>you 
320.632:>>Person1>>yeah okay 
320.754:>>Person2>>yeah okay
325.424:>>Person1>>%HESITATION milk yeah 
325.562:>>Person3>>%HESITATION and in the milk probably yeah
325.669:>>Person2>>no okay
330.337:>>Person3>>I say the pistol should be last because like why if you don't have a gun what would the pistols be yeah yeah I say that should be fifteen do you guys agree like the last one 
330.496:>>Person2>>and then
332.202:>>Person1>>me too
334.827:>>Person1>>yeah like someone's going to get like mad at another person when we can't find the things someone's gonna like 
342.638:>>Person1>>I would agree with that
344.336:>>Person2>>I mean like 
344.336:>>Person2>>yeah I I I doesn't see anything you need to like shoot on the moon  so like
344.398:>>Person3>>what do you think
345.35:>>Person1>>'cause like there's nothing on the moon that's like we're gonna need to shoot
351.389:>>Person3>>hahaha
351.467:>>Person1>>okay fifteen
356.853:>>Person3>>%HESITATION 
359.874:>>Person3>>for we're twelve right 
359.966:>>Person2>>I think the rope should be twelve yeah the rope yeah the rope
364.245:>>Person1>>I think the rope that seems like the most helpful out of all of the three 
365.046:>>Person3>>yeah that's yeah that's low yeah
371.31:>>Person2>>it's twelve okay
371.931:>>Person1>>and then I guess like maybe parachute silk 'cause like we might be able to use them together or something
376.888:>>Person3>>yeah that could also be used as like survival like an extra like blanket even you know so we can put that as thirteen 
380.431:>>Person2>>mhm
380.552:>>Person1>>yeah 
384.927:>>Person2>>thirteen okay fourteen's the the life raft
386.547:>>Person3>>yeah right that looks good
386.647:>>Person1>>yeah 
388.502:>>Person2>>okay
391.862:>>Person1>>how similar is it to your original one because mine's like pretty similar 
395.315:>>Person3>>it's pretty similar it's only off by like
398.924:>>Person3>>a few numbers
400.756:>>Person2>>yeah same it's like
403.142:>>Person2>>one or two off 
406.908:>>Person3>>I agree
412.265:>>Person1>>yeah
412.271:>>Person2>>yeah
