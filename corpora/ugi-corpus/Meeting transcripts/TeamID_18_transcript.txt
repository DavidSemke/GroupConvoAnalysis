0.0:>>Person4>>Sweet. 
2.466:>>Person4>>Alright so what do you guys think is most important of what we need? I'm thinking I need to live, right? I need to survive. Cool.
9.983:>>Person3>>Yeah I put oxygen for number one.
11.078:>>Person2>>Yeah the first. 
11.218:>>Person1>>Yeah, so, breathing. 
12.425:>>Person4>>Okay that's what I put as first too, yeah.
12.689:>>Person2>>Is that everyone's first? Okay. 
13.795:>>Person4>>Alright so, great. 
15.916:>>Person2>>Survive the two hundred miles, right?
18.103:>>Person4>>Okay, yeah, and then I'm like, okay I need some water, 
19.985:>>Person2>>Water yeah.
20.14:>>Person4>>I need to live.
24.321:>>Person4>>Anyone have different thoughts?
24.467:>>Person3>>Yeah, well I put solar powered FM receiver.
27.874:>>Person4>>Okay.
28.86:>>Person1>>I 
29.903:>>Person3>>I didn't know if there was a way if there's people on the mother ship to communicate with them.
33.037:>>Person4>>Okay. 
33.515:>>Person2>>Yeah
33.884:>>Person1>>I put heat above that, *HESITATION* only because before I *HESITATION* get thirsty I'm going to be cold on the moon. 
40.093:>>Person3>>Yeah.
41.363:>>Person4>>Okay, 
44.32:>>Person4>>true.
44.434:>>Person2>>Before you get thirsty.
46.508:>>Person2>>%HESITATION So second was portable heating unit, okay.
49.418:>>Person1>>For me, yes. 
51.019:>>Person4>>Hm. 
51.59:>>Person1>>Like, if you know *HESITATION* Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs, yeah.
52.221:>>Person3>>It's
54.137:>>Person4>>Yeah.
56.557:>>Person3>>Yeah, I mean it is really cold, I wasn't sure if like, I don't know, if you have the suit
58.852:>>Person1>>Right.
60.247:>>Person3>>you're wearing if that would heat up 
61.998:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
63.36:>>Person3>>but I think 
65.795:>>Person2>>Yeah.
65.982:>>Person3>>I'd go with %HESITATION the heating suit because
69.557:>>Person3>>realistically it is pretty cold on there.
71.839:>>Person3>>You wouldn't be able to survive.
74.488:>>Person3>>What do you guys think? 
75.426:>>Person4>>I think if you can't survive, then absolutely you need the heating. I don't know how cold it is on the moon. 
79.567:>>Person2>>Yeah, I don't know what
80.89:>>Person2>>I mean.
81.106:>>Person1>>I mean, it said we're not on the lighted side. Right? So
83.588:>>Person4>>Yeah.
84.422:>>Person2>>Yeah.
85.69:>>Person4>>If it's like. 
86.181:>>Person1>>That's
86.614:>>Person2>>So how we can get the solar powered FM receiver to work?
90.515:>>Person4>>Yeah, that's a good point if there's no sun, then it's kind of 
94.303:>>Person3>>Yeah, alright, true.
94.482:>>Person4>>no point having that. 
96.912:>>Person3>>Do you wanna, do you wanna go with the heating?
98.565:>>Person2>>Heating unit,
98.733:>>Person4>>Heating for two. 
100.005:>>Person2>>and then water?
102.586:>>Person3>>So it's portable heating unit.
102.82:>>Person4>>Portable heating, right. So then, since we're nice and warm, we're getting 
102.82:>>Person4>>a little thirsty. It's hot in the space suit. We need some water. 
106.827:>>Person3>>And then, and then water. Yeah.
108.412:>>Person2>>And then water.
108.898:>>Person3>>I'll go with water.
109.825:>>Person4>>Cool.
111.05:>>Person4>>%HESITATION 
113.988:>>Person4>>As far as still staying alive I'm gonna 
113.988:>>Person4>>throw food in there. Just cause I'm gonna need food, unless someone could think of something that's more important than food within a certain amount of time. 
118.595:>>Person3>>Yeah.
123.996:>>Person4>>Cause you're gonna die after like five days. 
124.076:>>Person2>>I just think,
125.569:>>Person1>> Right.
126.682:>>Person2>>I put like food as like a little later on, because if we had water we could survive for maybe a week
134.998:>>Person4>>Okay. 
135.534:>>Person3>>Yeah.
135.571:>>Person2>>%HESITATION without food.
138.111:>>Person3>>Yeah, so do you want to, like, leave food off for now? If you could.
141.737:>>Person1>>I *HESITATION*
141.76:>>Person4>>%HESITATION
142.11:>>Person2>>I'm just not sure what's
143.749:>>Person1>>Put the stellar map above 
144.006:>>Person2>>Yeah, yeah.
144.857:>>Person1>>*HESITATION* food concentrate.
145.37:>>Person4>>Cause it could help you get there quicker. 
148.783:>>Person1>>Yeah, it's no, you're not going to be eating if you're just wandering aimlessly, was my idea.
151.188:>>Person3>>Yeah.
152.324:>>Person2>>Yeah.
152.994:>>Person4>>True.
155.578:>>Person2>>So stellar map?
156.355:>>Person3>>Yup.
156.759:>>Person4>>Yeah, that makes sense. 
158.597:>>Person2>>Does anyone know how to read that?
159.674:>>Person4>>No. 
160.067:>>Person2>>No one knows!
160.972:>>Person3>>Can you even use a magnetic compass?
163.59:>>Person4>>That's what I was thinking. I don't think you can. 
164.488:>>Person2>>Yeah that's what I was wondering about, I put that as fourteen because I was like not sure.  
168.331:>>Person4>>I was also thinking about matches, right. You can use matches in space. 
171.137:>>Person2>>Oh I didn't know that. Because I was like, %HESITATION maybe? %HESITATION 
171.861:>>Person4>>There's no air. 
175.626:>>Person3>>Alright.
177.469:>>Person2>>Yeah what would be like the most 
179.994:>>Person2>>helpful to get us there.
181.936:>>Person4>>Most helpful? 
182.216:>>Person2>>I thought the solar powered one was like
182.317:>>Person4>>It it kind of depends, right? Like how, so solar power %HESITATION I thought about that too but then you brought up a point about the sun. There's no sun so we're just gonna be like. 
188.878:>>Person1>>Right.
188.899:>>Person2>>Then if there's a, yeah.
192.091:>>Person3>>But there's, there is,
193.351:>>Person2>>There is like a lighted part of the moon, though. I'm just like not sure
194.440:>>Person3>>yeah.
196.686:>>Person4>>I guess what side of the moon on, right? Cause if we get.
196.778:>>Person2>>where we are.
199.85:>>Person3>>Well doesn't it rotate?
200.012:>>Person2>>Oh the lighted, oh.
202.305:>>Person1>>Yeah, if we get dark side of the moon it's, hell no.
202.525:>>Person2>>We're two hundred miles from that.
204.887:>>Person2>>So the mother ship is on the lighted surface of the moon. We're two hundred miles from that. 
205.075:>>Person4>>It depends. Well, does, is it kind of like earth, right? Where it gets lit every so often cause if its two hundred miles. 
210.383:>>Person1>>It's tidally locked.
211.285:>>Person2>>Oh.
212.423:>>Person4>>It's what? 
213.246:>>Person1>>*HESITATION* No it's not tidally locked, *HESITATION* I misspoke.
216.263:>>Person4>>So. 
219.135:>>Person3>>So, do you want to go with the solar powered
221.111:>>Person3>>FM receiver?
223.461:>>Person3>>Because that might be our, that might be our only way of communicating.
223.502:>>Person2>>After the map?
226.636:>>Person4>>Yeah.
226.664:>>Person2>>Yeah we can, we can try, yeah. 
228.619:>>Person4>>Okay.
229.997:>>Person2>>At least. We could give it a go.
230.027:>>Person4>>We can give it a go. Oh, you know what, we never put first aid on there. I think that's really important. 
231.733:>>Person3>>Okay.
235.516:>>Person3>>You want to go with that? Six.
236.257:>>Person4>>Just in case we get hurt, right? Or, should we, should we put, 
238.17:>>Person3>>Oh yeah, because.
238.813:>>Person2>>After the solar power?
239.164:>>Person4>>what what do we think's gonna happen first, we get hurt, or we need food? 
241.349:>>Person2>>We need food. Oh.
242.149:>>Person3>>We get hurt. Oh.
242.71:>>Person4>>I don't know if I trip. Yeah we just crashed, what if we're already hurt? 
244.237:>>Person3>>Oh wait, we just crashed.
244.365:>>Person1>>We need food.
245.56:>>Person1>> I mean what are the dangers?
247.787:>>Person2>>Ooh, plot twist!
248.14:>>Person4>>Shit, we gotta redo this whole thing.
249.147:>>Person3>>Let's put that at six cause 
254.047:>>Person3>>or maybe should we put it five and then.
256.029:>>Person1>>It's easy to turn five into a six.
256.082:>>Person4>>What's?
257.691:>>Person3>>Yeah, should we do that?
258.436:>>Person4>>I could also just cross it out.
261.186:>>Person2>>So we're doing six? Oh, okay.
261.448:>>Person4>>Six. So five is gonna be first aid kit. Cause I think that's more important, important than 
263.752:>>Person3>>Yeah.
265.534:>>Person3>>Yeah.
267.789:>>Person2>>Okay.
268.17:>>Person4>>something that might not work. 
269.793:>>Person2>>Yeah, true.
271.303:>>Person4>>Okay %HESITATION 
272.256:>>Person2>>Is a random that we had like four as the stellar map and then five is the first aid kit? 
277.954:>>Person4>>No, cause we're trying to get their most importantly, right? So if like we know that we can get there, then maybe we can carry the hurt people. But if we know that's gonna be a long way, then like alright and we need some medicine here. 
280.049:>>Person2>>Okay.
284.46:>>Person2>>Okay.
287.709:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
288.552:>>Person2>>We can make them fly.
289.94:>>Person2>>Just, like, push them.
290.253:>>Person4>>Meet you there! 
292.128:>>Person3>>%HESITATION
293.476:>>Person4>>Okay so now do we start focusing on food? 
296.602:>>Person2>>So after solar powered,
297.326:>>Person3>>Yeah well, do we want to get some food?
297.377:>>Person4>>Right, like, we gotta.
299.295:>>Person4>>I'm kinda hungry.
299.953:>>Person2>>Do you guys know anything about the other stuff like, what can we not, like what's the
302.968:>>Person4>>I think, I think matches and the magnetic compass might, kind of, not work, right? Cause magnetic compass works with. 
303.38:>>Person3>>Well.
306.649:>>Person2>>Be like last?
308.292:>>Person3>>Don't.
309.919:>>Person2>>Which means signal flares won't.
310.83:>>Person4>>Signal flares shouldn't work either. That makes, right, because there's no air. 
312.241:>>Person2>>Okay.
312.731:>>Person3>>We don't.
313.545:>>Person2>>So that's one of the last?
313.633:>>Person1>>Do they run on oxygen?
314.865:>>Person4>>I'm pretty sure it's like fire, right? 
316.532:>>Person1>>I thought it was like 
317.911:>>Person3>>Yeah, it needs oxygen. Right?
319.725:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
319.954:>>Person1>>Oh, okay.
320.045:>>Person3>>Oh, wait, flares? 
320.159:>>Person1>>Yeah, I wouldn't know. Yeah.
321.464:>>Person3>>Oh yeah, cause they can go under water.
323.329:>>Person4>>Can they? Oh.
324.417:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
325.5:>>Person3>>They don't need oxygen.
325.514:>>Person2>>Oh! Ohh!
326.034:>>Person1>>They're, they, they create their own oxygen using other *HESITATION* like, decomposition and they use oxygen to make the light. I think?
329.238:>>Person4>>Interesting.
333.064:>>Person4>>So, when would we need flares though? Just in case like the mother ships taking off, right? And we're like a couple miles away ans we're like no! 
333.269:>>Person2>>Okay.
333.854:>>Person3>>So everything.
338.376:>>Person3>>What if we like, what if?
339.942:>>Person2>>Unless we can use that and if they can come to us that would be a lot easier than us coming to them.
339.986:>>Person1>>I mean 
343.896:>>Person4>>Yeah because I'm sure they have more than fifteen things on their ship.
344.427:>>Person1>>And
346.072:>>Person1>>And we could end he trek earlier than two hundred miles, if it, yeah.
349.852:>>Person2>>Yeah, exactly.
350.002:>>Person3>>Yeah.
350.869:>>Person4>>True.
351.402:>>Person3>>Alright, seven? Yeah.
352.185:>>Person2>>That'd be seven.
352.247:>>Person4>>Seven, yeah. Deal. 
354.495:>>Person2>>Signal flare.
355.945:>>Person4>>Okay. 
359.548:>>Person2>>%HESITATION Cool.
362.113:>>Person2>>Would box of matches be fifteen?
363.893:>>Person4>>Yeah I put, yeah. And then you guys wanna do compass as fourteen? 
365.572:>>Person1>>Okay, yeah. Yup.
365.702:>>Person3>>Yeah.
367.75:>>Person3>>Sure.
368.846:>>Person4>>Works. 
370.492:>>Person4>>%HESITATION I'm gonna say food for eight, right. I'm still pretty hungry. 
370.704:>>Person2>>Okay.
372.277:>>Person1>>Okay.
373.065:>>Person3>>Yeah.
373.233:>>Person2>>Food concentrate? Oh perfect.
374.268:>>Person4>>%HESITATION Yeah unless anyone likes dehydrated milk. What is that, like powdered milk? 
374.522:>>Person1>>Yes.
379.307:>>Person4>>Do you eat that or do you kinda just like poof? 
379.555:>>Person2>>I don't know how that would,
379.755:>>Person1>>I think so.
381.185:>>Person1>>I think you have to add water.
381.386:>>Person2>>Poof. Add water.
382.393:>>Person4>>You could add water. Oh, so we have water, so now we got milk. 
385.425:>>Person2>>Is there an argument for like 
390.05:>>Person2>>why milk would be better than water? I don't think so.
390.394:>>Person4>>Well, 
391.145:>>Person2>>Powdered milk.
391.279:>>Person4>>why milk would be better than water? Well we need the water in order to make the milk usable, 
392.247:>>Person2>>Yeah?
392.998:>>Person4>>right? %HESITATION But the argument with, do we want milk over food, I think I'd rather have food. 
395.444:>>Person2>>So,
397.472:>>Person2>>yeah.
397.713:>>Person3>>But we don't.
399.055:>>Person1>>Yes.
399.909:>>Person2>>yeah.
401.639:>>Person3>>Yeah we dont need, wait.
401.639:>>Person3>>%HESITATION Question, for the parachute silk what is? %HESITATION no.
408.444:>>Person2>>Okay. Cool.
408.466:>>Person3>>Okay.
408.635:>>Person4>>No. I think it's just kinda, I want to %HESITATION just imagine like a blanket, right, to be warm. Or maybe it's like the parachute that we used to land and maybe we could just take it with us to be warm or something. 
412.256:>>Person2>>What is parachute silk?
413.317:>>Person3>>Okay, I would say.
413.335:>>Person2>>Yeah.
416.798:>>Person3>>Yeah 
419.303:>>Person3>>So now I'm thinking that we use both the nylon rope and the parachute to help like drag this.
423.273:>>Person4>>Okay.
425.183:>>Person4>>Ooh, damn. You're right.
425.57:>>Person3>>all the supplies that we have.
427.721:>>Person2>>Damn. The five gallons of water.
429.569:>>Person4>>That's true.
430.372:>>Person3>>If everyone like pulls on the rope.
432.103:>>Person4>>Alright. I think that should be 
432.103:>>Person4>>where we're at because I think that's more convenient than mandatory. Yeah, that's a good spot for that. So where are we at nine? 
438.343:>>Person3>>So,
440.201:>>Person3>>so nine and ten.
440.314:>>Person2>>So.
440.386:>>Person4>>Nine and ten. Ooh, but what's more imortant? I'm gonna say that rope's more important just in case we reach a mountain.
443.102:>>Person3>>Okay.
444.877:>>Person1>>Or a crater, which is more likely. Or, I guess, the most likely.  
447.438:>>Person4>>Yeah, or a crater.
447.664:>>Person3>>Yeah.
450.051:>>Person2>>A mountain.
450.811:>>Person4>>Dude, I don't know anything about the moon. I should not have been on this trip. Don't know why you guys invited me. %HESITATION 
455.577:>>Person2>>Okay we got caliber pistols, milk, and life raft.
457.103:>>Person3>>Alright, you wanna go milk.
459.83:>>Person4>>As far as like still surviving, you know, I think milk is more important but what if we find some like moon monsters. 
466.633:>>Person2>>I'm thinking, well if these 
467.084:>>Person4>>Are are pistols gonna work the same on the moon? It's like
469.948:>>Person2>>Yeah %HESITATION I don't know they kind of just travel through.
470.055:>>Person3>>I think so.
470.159:>>Person4>>or is it like,
472.123:>>Person3>>No.
472.215:>>Person1>>I don't know, they really mess up underwater. The Mythbusters had like *HESITATION*
473.256:>>Person4>>it just. Yeah right, cause there's no.
475.862:>>Person2>>I would just put that
478.23:>>Person4>>But wouldn't it does go forever? It wouldn't stop, right? It would just go the same speed forever. So what if like you're aiming at a monster you acccidentally hit the mother ship? 
480.053:>>Person3>>Yeah,
482.211:>>Person3>>it would.
485.562:>>Person2>>I was thinking more,
486.126:>>Person4>>It breaks through the window.
486.171:>>Person1>>Why would go forever? There's still, gravity it's just a sixth.
490.721:>>Person4>>Oh, it would just go a lot longer, not forever. 
491.502:>>Person3>>Yeah.
493.314:>>Person2>>I was thinking more of like sound wise for the caliber pistols. Like if you
497.335:>>Person3>>Oh yeah.
497.505:>>Person2>>%HESITATION because you know you don't really know that it's gonna go.
501.751:>>Person3>>We could try that. So do you want to put that next?
503.949:>>Person2>>Eleven? %HESITATION No, %HESITATION dehydrated milk, what's more important.
504.512:>>Person3>>Or.
507.989:>>Person2>>Life raft in land.
507.992:>>Person3>>Yeah, eleven.
508.011:>>Person4>>Life raft. 
511.083:>>Person3>>Next one's eleven, so
513.868:>>Person3>>We don't need the life raft.
516.631:>>Person2>>What could we use life raft for?
519.271:>>Person4>>I think it would just be for like sleeping in, right? Like, that's not. 
519.888:>>Person2>>Any argument?
521.053:>>Person3>>Dragging stuff or sleeping in it.
523.191:>>Person2>>Yeah, we can all like cuddle up under the parachute silk.
525.352:>>Person4>>Yeah, but I need like something cozy to sleep on, you know, that's why we need the life raft. But I would say that's thirteen probably.
534.985:>>Person2>>Thirteen?
535.111:>>Person4>>Yeah.
535.834:>>Person3>>So, what did we do for eleven? Caliber pistols? 
536.812:>>Person4>>%HESITATION 
537.319:>>Person2>>Okay, thirteen.
539.297:>>Person2>>Are we doing thirteen for life raft?
539.611:>>Person4>>Pistols or dehydrated milk? What do you guys think is most important? 
542.267:>>Person2>>%HESITATION 
544.436:>>Person2>>At this point I don't know.
548.263:>>Person4>>How does sound work in space? Is it the same? 
548.596:>>Person2>>I mean if we have food, because food concentrate you need water to like, right? To.
553.336:>>Person1>>It doesn't in space. It's because there's no, there's no %HESITATION medium for it to work through.
554.477:>>Person4>>There's no sound?
556.323:>>Person2>>Oh!
558.058:>>Person4>>So then the, so then the pistol should be twelve. Right? 
558.546:>>Person2>>Oh my god, we're so dumb.
560.631:>>Person3>>Yeah.
561.988:>>Person2>>Okay.
563.496:>>Person4>>This is why I'm an architecture major. Then dehydrated milk is eleven.
564.954:>>Person2>>Twelve, thirteen, and then eleven?
568.884:>>Person2>>Okay, I think we're good with that.
571.086:>>Person4>>Cool.
571.645:>>Person3>>Alright, I think we made it.
