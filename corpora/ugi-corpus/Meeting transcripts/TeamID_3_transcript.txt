2.419:>>Person1>>so I think we will start from %HESITATION the least important item which I suspect is like the pistol
8.147:>>Person1>>it has
9.003:>>Person4>>I agree to that
9.582:>>Person1>>have you filled it close to the bottom like I filled it at fifteen
11.633:>>Person2>>oh yeah I have filled it in the pistol in fifteen
11.689:>>Person3>>yeah 
13.607:>>Person1>>fifteen
14.921:>>Person4>>I agree to that yeah
15.495:>>Person2>>yeah I did but okay
16.218:>>Person1>>you? fifteen
16.541:>>Person3>>I had it at fourteen but only because I saw that
19.708:>>Person3>>milk last so
20.783:>>Person2>>okay yeah so I think
21.430:>>Person1>>okay
22.018:>>Person3>>I would have put it at fifteen
22.725:>>Person2>>yeah yeah yeah so okay so the pistol will be fifteen
23.745:>>Person4>>okay
24.311:>>Person1>>okay
26.739:>>Person2>>and
27.958:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
29.336:>>Person2>>I put in parachute silk in fourteen or
31.536:>>Person2>>what %HESITATION yeah
31.809:>>Person1>>I put it at fourteen as well because you know I found that
33.897:>>Person4>>okay
34.424:>>Person3>>the silk
35.263:>>Person3>>I put it at seven
35.274:>>Person2>>yeah it's the silk? okay  
36.612:>>Person1>>okay
36.615:>>Person3>>because for heat at night
39.938:>>Person3>>%HESITATION you're not going to walk two hundred miles in a day so in a moon day or whatever
41.015:>>Person1>>yeah
43.982:>>Person2>>okay so what what is in fourteen in in your list?
48.212:>>Person2>>so what is fourteen in your list?
49.002:>>Person3>>oh fourteen?
50.47:>>Person3>>well I had the pistol
52.021:>>Person2>>oh
52.410:>>Person1>>okay yeah
52.422:>>Person3>>I guess in place of that would be the milk
53.284:>>Person2>>oh okay well so what is fifteen?
55.107:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
55.350:>>Person3>>%HESITATION the milk dehydrated milk
57.276:>>Person2>>oh okay
58.032:>>Person1>>okay
58.078:>>Person3>>I don't think that's very nutritious
58.474:>>Person2>>yeah
59.251:>>Person2>>so what what do you think?
60.961:>>Person4>>I 
61.895:>>Person1>>I have also filter close to the bottom like eleven
65.416:>>Person4>>I had like twelve but %HESITATION I mean if he says it's necessary for warmth maybe we should just keep it for now and %HESITATION so fourteen I had the map of the moon's constellations because it's just I mean
65.485:>>Person2>>oh yeah %HESITATION 
69.858:>>Person2>>yeah yeah yeah
70.764:>>Person2>>yeah yeah yeah so
72.318:>>Person1>>yeah
75.976:>>Person2>>so %HESITATION
77.863:>>Person4>>I I  
79.223:>>Person4>>I don't know how you escalated it
79.229:>>Person2>>oh I put it very higher up and then I yeah
80.878:>>Person3>>yeah I put it high too
81.713:>>Person1>>I think I would agree that there are more reliable and I think there are other techniques to map the location
86.777:>>Person4>>yeah
87.285:>>Person2>>okay yeah
88.472:>>Person2>>okay so %HESITATION the in fourteen we can put
91.871:>>Person1>>I
92.507:>>Person1>>%HESITATION yeah we can put maybe
93.176:>>Person2>>whatever
94.915:>>Person1>>or we can actually decide what are the items that come low on our priority list and then we can 
97.525:>>Person2>>okay right yeah yeah
98.645:>>Person4>>can we like start from the first and go to the last?
101.280:>>Person1>>yeah
101.758:>>Person1>>I just started okay that's fine I just started lots with what tools are really something we can (inaudible) 
101.846:>>Person2>>yeah so I yeah 
103.222:>>Person2>>okay okay
105.214:>>Person4>>right yeah
105.382:>>Person2>>you know I mean the in and allows the remaining items that okay so
106.323:>>Person3>>yeah
107.959:>>Person4>>yeah 
109.984:>>Person4>>so anyway so so one I put the oxygen
112.222:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
112.262:>>Person2>>%HESITATION I me too oxygen yeah
113.775:>>Person3>>yeah oxygen
114.056:>>Person1>>oxygen yeah let's %HESITATION
114.327:>>Person4>>okay so we agree on that
117.691:>>Person4>>then for two
118.901:>>Person2>>I
119.712:>>Person2>>I put water in two so %HESITATION
121.048:>>Person1>>yeah
121.430:>>Person3>>I did as well
121.723:>>Person4>>okay yeah I mean I put the FM receiver but I think probably
125.466:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I put that on four yeah I mean I regarded that as important
127.010:>>Person4>>okay but but but what I think probably what is the most important yeah
128.568:>>Person3>>still pretty high
129.260:>>Person2>>okay yeah so yep we so we can agree on water I think
132.557:>>Person4>>yeah yeah yeah that's fine yeah
132.819:>>Person3>>two? okay
132.896:>>Person1>>yeah
136.645:>>Person3>>%HESITATION for three I put food
136.675:>>Person4>>okay
139.209:>>Person1>>yeah I put four 
139.505:>>Person3>>that's the other essential one
140.925:>>Person2>>okay so
140.926:>>Person4>>yeah
140.950:>>Person3>>I don't know
141.118:>>Person4>>put the compass but yeah put I mean just for the sense of direction
141.960:>>Person2>>yeah I put around middle yeah so I think that one is fine as so what did you put?
143.099:>>Person3>>compass
150.086:>>Person1>>I put four down for
150.586:>>Person4>>I I would the compass because food I mean you can still go a while
151.456:>>Person2>>food okay so I think I put it on
154.150:>>Person3>>yeah do we agree on %HESITATION food for number three or?
157.533:>>Person2>>yeah yeah I also I put it on number four so yeah it's okay I think yeah
159.700:>>Person1>>so
160.736:>>Person1>>I think we I think there can be other ways you can actually find your location without using the compass maybe some kind of star gazing and stuff
161.205:>>Person4>>so 
161.463:>>Person3>>what do you
169.667:>>Person3>>yeah
170.706:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
170.932:>>Person3>>I mean I
171.088:>>Person3>>I put compass and %HESITATION stellar map as five and six cause like a combination of the two would tell you where you need to go
174.008:>>Person2>>mhm
180.548:>>Person3>>cause I don't think you can use the compass by itself
180.594:>>Person4>>I mean
183.195:>>Person3>>and
183.342:>>Person2>>so I I
184.464:>>Person2>>so I I I think I mean don't you think the map is important here too for navigation or something?
188.949:>>Person2>> yeah so
190.631:>>Person4>>the the which map? the
191.692:>>Person2>>and there's still a map there's still a map and compass
193.262:>>Person4>>oh the stellar map
194.780:>>Person2>>and both of these
196.536:>>Person4>>so one of these somebody
197.792:>>Person2>>and %HESITATION I mean both of these is important are important %HESITATION for direction
200.897:>>Person3>>yeah I think you need both to
201.933:>>Person4>>but what about the transmitter to communicate that's what I thought this is for right?
205.404:>>Person3>>that's true
205.639:>>Person2>>so I think yeah the receiver transmitter I mean I don't know
209.341:>>Person2>>that is not guaranteed
210.480:>>Person2>>I mean it's something yeah but you %HESITATION might not yeah totally
212.187:>>Person3>>yeah it doesn't tell you directions like they can't really guide you if if you communicate with them
217.117:>>Person3>>they can't really guide you to the
219.719:>>Person3>>base
219.87:>>Person1>>but I think that is crucial if you're finding them because if you don't probably know exactly where they are
220.104:>>Person2>>hmm
224.865:>>Person1>>so I mean the other instruments will tell us where we want to go but won't tell you the where it is the what locations 
228.332:>>Person2>>okay so yeah
229.924:>>Person2>>so the receiver transmitter
231.624:>>Person2>>what do you think the receiver transmitter map and compass three
234.693:>>Person4>>at these three probably %HESITATION need to go yeah like 
235.267:>>Person2>>%HESITATION both three 
236.917:>>Person1>>yeah
237.615:>>Person2>>yeah so we can put it yeah yeah put it one after another
237.984:>>Person4>>two three four yeah
239.530:>>Person4>>%HESITATION three four five yeah
240.640:>>Person2>>three four five yeah that's good
241.676:>>Person1>>oh I put food in that case yeah
243.481:>>Person2>>%HESITATION so hey I we have I don't know we have water
246.704:>>Person2>>so can %HESITATION can we
246.985:>>Person4>>yeah so water you can put it in survive for a few days probably
248.549:>>Person1>>yeah
249.769:>>Person1>>yeah I suppose so makes sense
250.114:>>Person2>>yeah
251.018:>>Person4>>but you at least have to go I mean you know
252.715:>>Person1>>yeah that makes sense
253.394:>>Person2>>good yeah
254.905:>>Person2>>okay so it %HESITATION
256.642:>>Person2>>we actually want receiver on three
257.046:>>Person4>>%HESITATION 
259.221:>>Person1>>yeah that makes sense
259.51:>>Person4>>yeah there is even
260.165:>>Person2>>compass on four and map on five or
261.936:>>Person4>>yeah
264.348:>>Person4>>compass on the where is the compass ah okay
265.318:>>Person2>>three
266.613:>>Person2>>compass on four and map on five
269.377:>>Person2>>so then we can %HESITATION put the food
269.706:>>Person4>>yeah and now here
271.793:>>Person1>>food yeah
272.102:>>Person4>>yeah then we can put the so maybe one of the foods on six or around
276.222:>>Person4>>anyway let's see 
276.271:>>Person2>>so there is food concentrate and also dehydrate milk so 
280.127:>>Person3>>yeah
282.077:>>Person4>>maybe the food is more nutritious than the milk yeah
283.198:>>Person2>>food is more important yeah because we have water already
284.133:>>Person3>>yeah it's
285.626:>>Person1>>we have water yeah precisely
285.679:>>Person1>>I %HESITATION
287.428:>>Person4>>it's %HESITATION we have the food and the water yeah
290.324:>>Person2>>so %HESITATION
290.938:>>Person4>>%HESITATION okay so
291.487:>>Person2>>will we put milk here or later on what do you think?
293.913:>>Person4>>put milk a little later but %HESITATION it depends I mean let's see what we have
294.799:>>Person2>>okay so yeah
295.348:>>Person1>>yeah
296.308:>>Person2>>makes sense
296.979:>>Person1>>what would a signal flare like
298.94:>>Person2>>%HESITATION I
299.411:>>Person1>>let's say the best sure of telling
301.395:>>Person1>>someone's they'd been out here I assume the use is for
303.439:>>Person2>>%HESITATION I don't know what's this how is this?
303.695:>>Person4>>yeah 
305.14:>>Person1>>I mean I'm assuming and I'm not sure
306.265:>>Person1>>but I assume that a signal flare is like you're giving some kind of marking that I am here so if
306.35:>>Person2>>okay 
307.145:>>Person4>>Assume it
311.862:>>Person2>>oh okay okay I get it yeah
312.775:>>Person1>>those guys it's themselves who come looking for us it's acually more optimal than us looking for them because we don't have supplies they do 
312.933:>>Person3>>yeah
318.925:>>Person2>>okay okay yeah
319.303:>>Person4>>okay so if we just start then yeah then that should be the next one yeah
319.494:>>Person3>>yeah
320.019:>>Person2>>so
321.860:>>Person2>>yeah yeah so if because it's
323.566:>>Person1>>but I'm not sure again like this is
324.133:>>Person2>>so but okay we found that there was something so pistol this %HESITATION
324.853:>>Person4>>let's assume it's that
329.124:>>Person4>>yeah
329.589:>>Person2>>%HESITATION here's you know nylon rope that's not much important
330.495:>>Person4>>were
332.853:>>Person4>>I actually put the heating unit at seven
334.749:>>Person2>>what is life raft does anyone know it?
336.742:>>Person4>>no I don't even know what that is
336.820:>>Person3>>%HESITATION it's
337.399:>>Person1>>what?
338.100:>>Person2>>a life raft
339.906:>>Person1>>life raft you know I'm not sure 
340.204:>>Person3>>I think it just
341.363:>>Person1>>I mean if it actually I assume that yeah if it does throw it like it allows you to lift from then it is definitely more important than you know because in because yeah I mean this by itself will help us survive I don't think it'll be that useful   
341.484:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
347.384:>>Person2>>oh okay
353.986:>>Person2>>okay yeah yeah
355.094:>>Person4>>yeah we already have a lot of important things so 
356.108:>>Person2>>yeah okay if there are things closer by
356.110:>>Person1>>yeah
358.499:>>Person2>>so okay so so in that case signal flares is a good option I think
361.389:>>Person4>>yeah let's put that's seven
361.418:>>Person1>>yeah
364.149:>>Person2>>seventh yeah
364.879:>>Person4>>then
366.073:>>Person4>>maybe so I actually put first kit put first aid kit at six but but that could be eight
368.657:>>Person2>>%HESITATION oh okay so 
371.270:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
372.251:>>Person2>>then I think parachute silk would be good
373.363:>>Person4>>yeah
374.518:>>Person2>>yeah those all seem perfect
374.529:>>Person1>>it yeah
377.140:>>Person2>>is it more important the signal flares or first aid kit what do you think?
380.140:>>Person1>>I don't think I mean what's the chance that you'll start like I mean you're having like literally a life and death situation I don't think first aid would be like
382.781:>>Person4>>%HESITATION it'll be covered
382.985:>>Person3>>it's it's just for emergencies
384.307:>>Person2>>oh okay oh yeah yeah yeah okay
388.136:>>Person2>>yeah yeah so %HESITATION
388.545:>>Person3>>yeah it's just if you get hurt or
390.024:>>Person2>>so that we can keep it on eight then
392.571:>>Person2>>first right?
393.459:>>Person3>>%HESITATION yeah 
393.727:>>Person4>>eight then %HESITATION we have 
394.556:>>Person2>>then we have the less important things
397.200:>>Person2>>like
398.886:>>Person4>>okay now we can put the food %HESITATION the milk I mean yeah
400.211:>>Person2>>the %HESITATION dehydrated milk yeah milk
401.710:>>Person1>>maybe dehydrated milk
403.199:>>Person2>>nine
404:>>Person1>>840
409.857:>>Person1>>yeah
405.707:>>Person3>>what about the silk? I think you need that for night
405.715:>>Person2>>so %HESITATION so 
407.347:>>Person4>>yeah now now the silk yeah
409.191:>>Person3>>well well how
409.210:>>Person2>>silk
410.677:>>Person3>>how long is a a moon day? like how often does %HESITATION
414.249:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
416.133:>>Person4>>less than the earth I think
418.092:>>Person4>>for sure it's less than the earth
420.336:>>Person3>>it is?
420.613:>>Person4>>maybe like six hours or something. Six or twelve hours.
423.298:>>Person3>>it'd be extremely cold
424.826:>>Person3>>I assume so
424.969:>>Person2>>oh yeah so heating unit is
426.641:>>Person4>>%HESITATION yes
427.011:>>Person3>>you need a heating unit and I assume you need the silk as well
429.852:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
430.538:>>Person2>>but actually we will put on alright the %HESITATION 
431.330:>>Person1>>but
433.225:>>Person1>>do you have the astronaut suit I'm just asking like if we have the suit then there's no
433.909:>>Person2>>yeah 
434.859:>>Person2>>so 
435.871:>>Person3>>yeah I don't know like how 
437.745:>>Person4>>yeah it depends
438.694:>>Person3>>well 
438.953:>>Person1>>it's I think that's not very clear here
440.254:>>Person2>>mmm
440.814:>>Person3>>yeah
441.344:>>Person2>>yeah yeah so
443.367:>>Person2>>but we can assume that we have suit obviously I mean otherwise %HESITATION
446.403:>>Person4>>yeah yeah I probably yeah
446.838:>>Person3>>yeah
447.441:>>Person1>>yeah
447.848:>>Person2>>all right these are less important so yeah we can just on something %HESITATION
450.05:>>Person4>>yeah so
451.983:>>Person4>>so nine is %HESITATION
453.937:>>Person2>>parachute silk so
454.844:>>Person4>>parachute
455.269:>>Person2>>I think heating unit is more important than the other of the things
458.134:>>Person3>>yeah I think so
459.332:>>Person1>>what will we be using as a heating unit? like where
461.652:>>Person2>>%HESITATION
462.776:>>Person4>>so the heating unit would have been for an inside environment right?
466.474:>>Person4>>not for an outside
467.407:>>Person2>>okay oh so I thought it was something
469.035:>>Person4>>so then if we don't have an %HESITATION
469.223:>>Person2>>oh yeah yeah yeah
472.007:>>Person4>>if we're going to be out then what's the use of that?
474.072:>>Person2>>oh
474.281:>>Person4>>we can put it fourteen as well
474.946:>>Person3>>well how
476.251:>>Person1>>again because parachute silk and heating and yeah I mean parachute silk also keeps you warm in a way
476.695:>>Person3>>how does it heat if it's like
482.623:>>Person3>>yeah but you don't have %HESITATION air like an atmosphere to conduct the heat
482.898:>>Person1>>so does he
487.871:>>Person4>>yeah so it's useless
487.894:>>Person1>>yeah
488.412:>>Person2>>yeah
490.595:>>Person1>>so I think this parachute silk will probably be more important
492.211:>>Person2>>so I mean
493.035:>>Person2>>yeah he got a good point heating unit is mainly for inside
495.63:>>Person4>>so that so we can put that at fourteen yeah
497.509:>>Person2>>something I mean
498.271:>>Person3>>with oxygen
499.823:>>Person3>>but like where would we use that cause we don't really have environment
502.634:>>Person2>>yeah so we can put it later
503.238:>>Person4>>yeah so put it at fourteen right?
504.803:>>Person2>>yeah
505.149:>>Person1>>yeah
506.707:>>Person2>>oh wait %HESITATION we have to put ten so which one
509.670:>>Person1>>oh where'd we put this life raft because that's kind of we are not sure exactly what it is
513.280:>>Person4>>yeah I'm not sure so
513.584:>>Person2>>yeah yeah
516.338:>>Person2>>so and also there's the box of matches
516.504:>>Person4>>but
520.169:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
520.892:>>Person2>>okay so we are keeping heating unit in fourteen
524.848:>>Person4>>so we need ten eleven twelve
526.233:>>Person2>>yeah
526.731:>>Person4>>yeah we still need
526.762:>>Person1>>yeah
527.302:>>Person2>>okay so fourteen heating unit
528.713:>>Person3>>yeah
529.477:>>Person4>>ten eleven twelve thirteen
529.546:>>Person1>>heating unit in fourteen yeah
531.5:>>Person2>>so life raft we don't know what is this
531.659:>>Person4>>wait wait
532.415:>>Person4>>so parachute silk was quite high right?
534.215:>>Person2>>I think life we can put life raft in thirteen
534.982:>>Person4>>and that was at ten?
537.002:>>Person2>>I mean what is the use
537.445:>>Person1>>I put on fourteen
539.776:>>Person2>>%HESITATION yeah so like
541.146:>>Person2>>life raft what is this I don't know
542.133:>>Person4>>yeah yeah yeah that's fine so so so that's thirteen right thirteen
543.304:>>Person2>>okay so then put it thirteen yeah
545.203:>>Person1>>thirteen yeah
546.347:>>Person2>>and then three left so
549.461:>>Person4>>and parachute
549.782:>>Person2>>ten eleven twelve
549.913:>>Person3>>a match
551.262:>>Person4>>so parachute silk was at ten right? yeah and then %HESITATION
552.465:>>Person2>>yeah that makes sense
554.515:>>Person2>>ten
555.413:>>Person2>>nylon might put
555.976:>>Person4>>nylon rope
