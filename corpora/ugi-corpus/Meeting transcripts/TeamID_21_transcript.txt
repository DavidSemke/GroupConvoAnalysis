2.44:>>Person3>>Alright, so, I don't know.
4.1:>>Person2>>I believe a good place to start is 
5.73:>>Person4>>Start with one or fifteen.
6.86:>>Person2>>what are our needs? 
8.37:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
8.79:>>Person2>>What our needs as individuals? We have crashed, not crash landed but force landed. 
10.43:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
11.99:>>Person3>>Yeah.
14.47:>>Person2>>We need to breathe. 
14.8:>>Person4>>Yeah.
14.9:>>Person3>>Yes. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Eat. Food. 
15.71:>>Person5>>We need water.
16.24:>>Person2>>We need to eat. 
17.56:>>Person2>>We need to, we need to drink, yup. We need to stay warm, right? 
18.28:>>Person5>>Water is more important, though.
19.65:>>Person3>>Yup.
19.86:>>Person1>>Yup. 
21.43:>>Person3>>Yup. Because the moon is cold. 
22.43:>>Person2>>So, I think number one is is breathe because like that that kills you real quick like, you know what I mean? 
25.14:>>Person3>>Breathe? Yes. 
28.05:>>Person4>>Yeah.
28.26:>>Person3>>Yep, we're trying, so trying to survive is the, like, kinda.  
28.45:>>Person1>>I agree. 
32.3:>>Person4>>I would assume like each - 
32.91:>>Person2>>So, do we have to have a five person consensus on the oxygen tanks? All right, let's put that down. 
35.36:>>Person3>>On number one is the tank. Okay, yes, alright.  
36.05:>>Person5>>Yes.
36.25:>>Person4>>Yes
38.95:>>Person3>>And I don't know about you guys but I also, like, to help me kind of rank through this, I also went through the stuff I don't need. Like, the things that we don't really need. 
46.49:>>Person4>>Yeah, we can start with fifteen too, like we mean go kind of opposite ends.
49.38:>>Person3>>Do you, do you want to work our way in? Or do, 
52.56:>>Person2>>I think, if anyone has anything, I think I'd like to start with needs because that's, like, just. 
52.82:>>Person3>>what do you guys think?
55.24:>>Person3>>Alright. 
56.92:>>Person3>>Okay, yeah. 
57.35:>>Person4>>Thats - yeah.
57.59:>>Person1>>I feel like they're the easiest to agree upon. 
59.74:>>Person3>>Yeah, needs. Okay, yeah.  
59.75:>>Person2>>Yeah, like, 
60.31:>>Person4>>Yeah.
60.42:>>Person5>>And then we can change it later, if we see something's-
61.61:>>Person2>>right. I think it's gonna get hazy toward the middle, at which point we can cut back to fifteen and work our way backward. 
61.66:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
61.72:>>Person4>>Well -
65.03:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
67.03:>>Person1>>I like it. 
67.16:>>Person3>>Alright, so, alright so, yeah, so breathing is important. 
71.46:>>Person3>>And you can survive days without food but water is also really important. So. 
76.4:>>Person2>>So 
76.81:>>Person4>>I'd -
77.42:>>Person5>>That's two, right?
77.97:>>Person2>>there's, there's water and there's heating. Because on the moon, like, it gets real cold at night. Like, real cold, although we have our, I assume we're wearing space suits, otherwise this is for naught. So. 
79.03:>>Person4>>Well 
79.37:>>Person1>>Well, what do you think? 
80.26:>>Person3>>There is heat.
83.64:>>Person3>>We could do. 
88.03:>>Person3>>Yeah. Yes. 
89.45:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
91.18:>>Person3>>Well, we get, I mean, if we're gonna, if we agree that alright, yes, portable heating is definitely up there, like, definitely top five. 
98.85:>>Person3>>But just in terms, yeah, actually. Like, either, so you're saying for number two? 
99.2:>>Person2>>I agree. 
103.49:>>Person2>>I'd say it's either water or heat and then food after that, I think. 
108.03:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
108.17:>>Person4>>Well -
108.46:>>Person1>>I would, I would say water. 
109.84:>>Person4>>I sort of assumed that like each spacesuit we're in like has sort of like basic needs that but that wouldn't like carry us for long. 
116.3:>>Person2>>Like, we could probably stay warm for, like, a day or so with it, maybe. Like, the batteries or whatever is it, maybe.  
120.62:>>Person4>>Yeah but -
120.99:>>Person1>>Yeah, what about it? 
121.04:>>Person5>>What are our basic needs?
122.64:>>Person4>>I thought the more - I put like for two and three I put like stuff that was necessary to get to the location because if we don't get to the location we would die, eventually anyway.
123.35:>>Person2>>So, I think. 
133.88:>>Person3>>See, okay, so you're talking about as stuff, like. %HESITATION 
134.7:>>Person2>>Do you have? So what do you have? 
135.11:>>Person1>>That makes sense. 
135.16:>>Person4>>Do you see what I'm saying? 
137.71:>>Person4>>Like the the map and the compass.
141.3:>>Person2>>That was, for me that was post basic needs. Because since it's two hundred miles a, like, a ten day journey if you assume twenty miles a day. Which, on the moon, is pretty hard pace to keep up. 
143.55:>>Person3>>Yeah, those were. 
151.86:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
152.09:>>Person3>>Yeah, I feel like %HESITATION definitely, see I, so we crash landed, right? But we're on the way so we can kind of know in what general direction. But, yes definitely knowing, like, at least a compass, like, those things are definitely one of those things that we do need. 
167.62:>>Person4>>I - I'm willing to say that water would be more important than that though, like hindsight.
171.84:>>Person2>>I think 
171.85:>>Person2>>Yeah, I didn't get that then. 
171.86:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
173.97:>>Person2>>if we agree, we should go for water next. 
176.04:>>Person3>>Alright, water is number two. And then, since this is a long. 
176.18:>>Person1>>I 
176.43:>>Person4>>Yeah 
176.56:>>Person2>>Okay. 
176.74:>>Person5>>Water's two?
177.86:>>Person1>>agree. 
178.55:>>Person5>>Yup.
181.01:>>Person2>>I. 
181.9:>>Person3>>See, if we, for, alright, in terms of heating, you guys might, like, we can, like, penguin style a group. 
189.12:>>Person2>>You can but it's also, like. 
191.79:>>Person5>>But how's the heater operated though? 
193.1:>>Person1>>How does that actually work? 
194.16:>>Person4>>Well -
194.64:>>Person2>>Okay, my assumption when I saw a portable heating unit is, like, 
199.01:>>Person3>>Something that can he all of us? Like, warm all of us?
200.66:>>Person2>>I would, I would assume, like, I would assume it's, like, solar. Like, we carry it around, soaks it up in the day, puts it out at night. Some sort of heat exchanger of some kind. 
201.5:>>Person5>>But how is it powered?
209.17:>>Person4>>But there is no night though.
209.31:>>Person3>>That, that's a safe.  
209.96:>>Person1>>Puts it out. 
212.06:>>Person4>>Like one dark side and one light side.
212.64:>>Person3>>Yeah, but there is. %HESITATION
212.69:>>Person2>>Oh, right.  
213.08:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
214.36:>>Person2>>Well. 
215.67:>>Person4>>I mean we need to sleep though.
216.41:>>Person1>>I mean the day, the day is twenty-seven days long. So. 
223.21:>>Person2>>Yeah the day is twenty, wait. 
224.66:>>Person1>>Tidally locked. 
226.26:>>Person2>>I'm trying to think about this real quick. 
233.68:>>Person1>>It's tidally, it's tidally locked. So the day is twenty twenty-seven days long. 
233.74:>>Person2>>Yeah, it's a, yeah, it's a twenty-seven day. Because it's not the same dark side every time. The dark side of the moon refers to the side we're not, we can't see. 
238.52:>>Person4>>Yeah.
238.85:>>Person1>>No. 
239.15:>>Person3>>Yeah, we're not facing, yeah. 
240.02:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
241.75:>>Person4>>But - 
242.12:>>Person3>>So, either it is, ooh, it's gonna be dark.  
242.18:>>Person2>>So, if we assume, 
245.42:>>Person2>>if it's gonna be night, then heating is, like, huge. Like, if we're on a dark, like, if it is dark for all ten days, then we are, like, heating is huge. 
247.88:>>Person3>>Yeah, so, 
249.09:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
249.59:>>Person1>>I mean there's a, like, there's not much, there's not really an atmosphere anyway. So. 
250.09:>>Person3>>but we also do need, 
254.42:>>Person3>>we do need, 
254.76:>>Person2>>Yeah, but, like, you can directly, thermodynamically absorb it. I assume it generates heat on some sort of solid object, which we can just, like, absorb 
254.87:>>Person4>>I mean but we- 
256.26:>>Person3>>alright. 
256.88:>>Person1>>Yeah, but how does the heater work? 
256.91:>>Person4>>So I think we should assume-
256.93:>>Person5>>so I think this is over we should 
262.43:>>Person1>>And we kind of touch the solid object? 
262.7:>>Person3>>Could we agree that, like, 
264.91:>>Person3>>food food and portable, 
265.0:>>Person5>>Or it radiates heat. 
265.43:>>Person2>>through thermodynamic properties. 
267.46:>>Person3>>could we agree that, like, food and portable heating is, like, one of the next two, like, it either interchangeable, like, upi need food and you need that heat.
273.1:>>Person4>>Yeah.
276.75:>>Person2>>Yeah, I put, yeah, I put food as.  
279.47:>>Person3>>Three. 
280.01:>>Person5>>I'd like to disagree on that.
281.31:>>Person3>>Alright, what'd? 
282.45:>>Person5>>The- the solar powered FM receiver transmitter, if you could- 
285.76:>>Person4>>Oh yeah I put that pretty high too. 
286.88:>>Person5>>Yeah if you took, if you could take the solar panel off of it or solar power part off of it you could use it to power your suits- um your suits.
287.16:>>Person2>>Yeah, I have that pretty high. 
287.65:>>Person1>>How did I? 
290.86:>>Person3>>Oh. 
292.18:>>Person4>>Or, you could contact the base and tell them to- 
296.44:>>Person1>>I I had the transmitter next as well. 
296.7:>>Person5>>True.
299.61:>>Person2>>Alright, so I think a top three, because, like, we've got radio, we've got heat, and we've got %HESITATION 
299.63:>>Person4>>I had a pretty high up there.
300.71:>>Person3>>Ooh, you're, okay. 
307.95:>>Person2>>food. And the solar powered FM receiver, maybe that also we could use that to, like, jack up our heating unit when we're not using our radio 
314.24:>>Person5>>Or your suits.
315.58:>>Person2>>or our suits. If our suits are, you know, like, whatever is the most efficient there we'd have to do some. 
316.27:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
319.06:>>Person3>>Alright, wait, 
320.23:>>Person3>>%HESITATION sorry, can I just, like, switch gears and, like, do we, alright, like, the one I have ranked fifteen is the life raft. Because do we? 
320.24:>>Person1>>Although, I mean, I don't know. 
327.98:>>Person5>>Yes. 
328.97:>>Person4>>Um...
329.1:>>Person2>>I I actually thought that would kind of be useful for blocking the sun if it's. 
334.68:>>Person1>>It would more useful than, say, a boxing matches. 
337.25:>>Person2>>Because, actually, on the moon, while there is no. Yeah, the box of matches and the forty five pistols. 
337.69:>>Person4>>There is no atmosphere.
337.78:>>Person3>>Yeah, alright, now that I think about. 
337.86:>>Person5>>True.
341.67:>>Person4>>The only use I found-
342.82:>>Person3>>Alright, alright, yeah that'll, okay, do we agree? 
343.2:>>Person2>>If you were, if you were going to use them, you would have to be, like, spraying oxygen through the chamber of the gun while you fired it. Otherwise, you would have to just be, like, venting oxygen into it while you fired it. 
344.92:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
351.79:>>Person1>>Well %HESITATION I believe, I believe bullets usually have their own oxidizer. But, like, that's a irrelevant right now. 
357.16:>>Person3>>Alright, do you guys agree that we, do you guys agree that bringing guns on this might be bad? 
357.22:>>Person4>>But like-
357.35:>>Person2>>It's also a pistol and we don't really need it. 
362.05:>>Person2>>I agree that that is a very bad. Would we like to put the guns at fifteen? 
362.66:>>Person1>>It's just, it's not really helpful 
362.67:>>Person5>>I mean, if you- if you need to commit suicide once your rations run out. 
363.99:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
365.78:>>Person4>>I mean-
368.12:>>Person1>>Alright then. %HESITATION 
368.32:>>Person3>>Alright, we need, someone needs to, yeah, exactly. Like, because I feel like that would cause a lot of tension. Like, oh, who has a gun? Like, oh man, people getting crazy, you know, someone might shoot us, so, like. 
368.42:>>Person2>>Take me. Remove your helmet. 
371.12:>>Person5>>But isn't a gun faster?
376.31:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
380.67:>>Person2>>Yeah, I would. 
381.16:>>Person5>>But if you- 
381.52:>>Person1>>It's also if we're trying to think in terms of survival, it's not really, it's not gonna help us at all, so. 
381.66:>>Person4>>So can-
385.4:>>Person3>>It's not necessary. Alright, I don't think there's gonna be moon creatures. Like, that's the only reason that I think. 
389.43:>>Person2>>Well, like, we have a mother ship there, right? So we would know if there was moon creatures.  
392.44:>>Person3>>Yeah, let's assume that there's no aliens. 
392.79:>>Person4>>I mean it's the- it's the noise though, it's kind of like the same deal with the flair gun, like get people's attention from- while you're close enough. 
399.28:>>Person3>>The flare gun, 
399.5:>>Person2>>Except that there's no. 
401.07:>>Person1>>There's no air to carry the sound. 
401.1:>>Person3>>the flare gun, I feel, see, see, yes. Signal flare is definitely, like, up there but again, like, that the two calibur forty-five caliber pistols, that would just, I think that would lead to tension. On, like, 
401.69:>>Person4>>I mean- Oh.
403.13:>>Person2>>Yeah, you wouldn't really hear it. 
404.51:>>Person4>>Upsetting.
406.25:>>Person2>>I know. I know. 
408.24:>>Person1>>forty five hundred 
409.04:>>Person2>>Yes. Same. 
412.51:>>Person2>>I agree. 
413.78:>>Person3>>and someone, like.
414.4:>>Person1>>Yeah, I mean, that and just useless. 
415.04:>>Person4>>Yeah, but it would be- 
416.75:>>Person4>>So can we agree that matches and %HESITATION pistols are our last two.
421.91:>>Person2>>Yeah, I would say matches are even lower. I'd say matches are fifteen and the guns are fourteen. 
423.7:>>Person4>>Yeah.
424.02:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
424.19:>>Person3>>Matches are lower? 
426.1:>>Person3>>Fifteen. 
426.8:>>Person4>>We good? 
428.18:>>Person3>>Fourteen, okay. 
430.24:>>Person3>>Cool, alright, so, like, 
433.04:>>Person3>>so jumping back to, like, the top priority ones. So, portable heating, food concentrate, and then, like, first what you guys feel about first aid? 
442.7:>>Person5>>No need. 
444.06:>>Person1>>%HESITATION
444.94:>>Person2>>I would say, I'd say that there's a need but I'd say it's after, definitely after radio, it's after %HESITATION food, and it's after heating. 
445.17:>>Person4>>No real need.
447.24:>>Person3>>Like, middle? 
448.47:>>Person4>>After navigation.
449.54:>>Person3>>Alright, yeah, so. 
449.86:>>Person1>>Definitely. 
451.14:>>Person1>>Because, I mean, odds are if you're in a situation where you're gonna need it, you're already dead, so. 
454.27:>>Person4>>And compass and maps.
455.79:>>Person3>>Yeah, that's true. okay.  
455.91:>>Person5>>True.
457.12:>>Person2>>If, I would I be willing to go FM receiver and then either heating or food and then the other. 
465.18:>>Person3>>FM receiver as number three then? 
468.11:>>Person2>>%HESITATION Yeah we put water as number two? 
470.54:>>Person3>>Yeah, so we did two, alright, so FM receiver as three then? Okay. 
470.76:>>Person4>>Yeah.
470.82:>>Person5>>Yeah.
474.75:>>Person1>>Alright. Yup. 
474.76:>>Person2>>I I'm okay with that if everyone else is. 
475.57:>>Person4>>Yeah and then water, heating is left. I would- or no, food- food and heating.
479.37:>>Person5>>Food and heating.
480.49:>>Person2>>We've got, yeah, food and heating. So which whichever one first. 
482.34:>>Person3>>Food and heating. 
483.52:>>Person3>>I feel like %HESITATION I do feel. 
484.21:>>Person4>>I-
485.42:>>Person5>>I mean, if we could travel really quickly per day, we could just use the heating and just ditch the food.
485.44:>>Person4>>Well- 
489.42:>>Person1>>I would put heating above food, probably. 
491.64:>>Person4>>Well I would think that our like spacesuits would have some sort of basic living- it might have some sort of heat system in it.
498.16:>>Person2>>I would assume they have a basic heat system. I don't know if they have a basic food system, which is a good. 
502.12:>>Person4>>They wouldn't have a basic food system so I would put food first.
502.69:>>Person3>>Yeah, I feel I feel like we would definitely. 
503.16:>>Person1>>Yeah, but you can last a lot longer without food than you can without heat. 
504.81:>>Person2>>You you can definitely go like a week before, like, you. It will will slow us down after like four days, though. It's going to be rough marching after four days through fucking moon.  
507.33:>>Person4>>That's true.
510.92:>>Person4>>But if we have the solar panel-
513.82:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
514.13:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
514.7:>>Person5>>But how would you eat the food?
515.82:>>Person4>>Yeah. 
516.54:>>Person3>>Well, I mean, that's something. I mean I feel like a lot of this stuff is. 
517.79:>>Person1>>That's that's just kind of logistics that I assume will be. 
519.03:>>Person2>>I, okay. 
520.92:>>Person2>>Okay, either the food concentrate is, like, a, like, a %HESITATION Soylent type deal, right? Or we need the first aid kit to inject the food concentrate into our veins. I don't know which way that goes. 
524.83:>>Person3>>Plus it's concentrate too, it so it's not, 
530.25:>>Person3>>I I, can we just assume that, like, we don't need, like, two, we don't need, say, like, oh box of matches and, like, we don't, like, these things are independent of each other for use. Can we assume that? 
543.01:>>Person2>>But we're not gonna use them to do other things? 
544.81:>>Person3>>Yeah, like, we don't need the first aid kit to use, to inject concentrate. That would be. 
548.05:>>Person2>>Yeah, I don't think so. First aid kit's also just useful and I thought about when I was looking at it. 
552.33:>>Person3>>Yeah, I feel you. 
552.82:>>Person4>>I mean, I would assume we need the water for the dehydrated milk. But we don't need the dehydrated milk for the water.
556.75:>>Person5>>Yes.
557.53:>>Person3>>See, okay I didn't. 
559.27:>>Person2>>Dude, the dehydrated milk might actually be, like, 
563.26:>>Person4>>Better than food.
564.4:>>Person2>>like, it's it's gonna provide us sustenance. 
564.49:>>Person1>>No. 
565.34:>>Person3>>No. 
567.67:>>Person1>>%HESITATION I mean, so would food. 
569.03:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
569.61:>>Person1>>It's like that but better. 
570.39:>>Person5>>But you'd still be thirsty.
570.86:>>Person4>>I mean, if it was hydrated milk, like that would be both food and water in the same thing, so that would work, but it's not. 
572.82:>>Person2>>Yeah.  
576.83:>>Person2>>Yeah. 
578.44:>>Person2>>I do we, do we just wanna go, %HESITATION you wanna go food first? Because we're going on the assumption that our suit has some sort of heating element. 
582.13:>>Person3>>Alright, food food and then.  
585.36:>>Person3>>So then food and then portable heating, though? Okay, so, 
587.59:>>Person2>>Yeah, so food is four? 
587.8:>>Person4>>Yeah.
589.43:>>Person3>>yeah, and then portable heating is five. 
591.33:>>Person2>>Okay.  
591.84:>>Person4>>Where is food? There is it.
591.93:>>Person3>>Alright, can we %HESITATION let's see. 
593.29:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
596.33:>>Person3>>Alight, so, after that 
600.1:>>Person3>>would you guys? 
600.12:>>Person5>>But how would you- 
600.44:>>Person1>>I would, I mean stellar map has to be pretty high up there, as well. 
603.74:>>Person5>>How would you get the food into your system?
603.78:>>Person3>>Like, navigation wise? 
605.54:>>Person2>>Yeah, I had stellar map next. 
606.14:>>Person1>>I %HESITATION I would assume that would, like, work with the suit or whatever. 
608.07:>>Person4>>I had that like way earlier, yeah.
608.44:>>Person3>>We could. 
610.11:>>Person2>>I I had, I had stellar map at six. 
610.57:>>Person5>>All right if there's a way.
613.42:>>Person3>>Alright, do you guys want stellar map next then? Because that does seem like something important for navigating. 
619.45:>>Person4>>That's better than a compass, right?
621.05:>>Person2>>Well I don't know, on the moon, compass, does it not? I don't know if it has an iron core.
621.4:>>Person3>>Well, see I felt like a magnet. 
621.47:>>Person1>>Does that moon, I don't, I don't think the moon has a magnetic field, does it? 
626.93:>>Person1>>I I don't think it has a magnetic field. 
627.34:>>Person2>>Although, wasn't the moon, like, a part of the earth at one point? So, like, it's probably all the same stuff. 
630.01:>>Person1>>Well, 
631.12:>>Person3>>Technicalities. 
631.97:>>Person1>>I thought it was relatively intactive. 
632.71:>>Person4>>I mean-
634.08:>>Person2>>Yeah, I would assume,
634.84:>>Person3>>So, do you guys agree stellar map higher than magnetic compass, then? 
636.05:>>Person2>>otherwise. Yeah, because the moon has no magnetic field protecting it from like sun rays, right? Right? 
636.32:>>Person1>>I would. 
641.07:>>Person3>>Oh, like. 
641.1:>>Person1>>I don't think so. 
641.45:>>Person4>>Well that's atmosphere.
642.89:>>Person2>>Well, there's atmosphere but then there's also the magnetic field protects us from radiation 
642.95:>>Person1>>Well, 
648.21:>>Person1>>Yeah. 
648.38:>>Person2>>as well as the atmosphere.
651.1:>>Person3>>Alright, so, 
651.13:>>Person2>>and I I don't, I think the moon just gets, like, destroyed by the sun. Like no hope. So I think stellar map. 
651.35:>>Person1>>So that, can we, 
651.65:>>Person4>>Oh.
653.84:>>Person1>>can we, can we agree with stellar map? 
654.13:>>Person3>>stellar map as number six. 
655.32:>>Person5>>We need navigation.
655.67:>>Person4>>Yeah, sure. 
658.62:>>Person3>>Alright so %HESITATION in terms of, alright, I kind of want to jump back again. %HESITATION With, alright, like, do we really need dehydrated, do you think dehydrated, dehydrated milk is, like, one of those things that we don't really need? 
670.63:>>Person4>>Hmm.
671.2:>>Person5>>No, we don't need it. 
672.63:>>Person1>>I would say it's higher than some of the other things on here. 
673.92:>>Person2>>I would say, I would say we don't need, like, now that I look at it again, with what would we really use rope for? 
680.23:>>Person3>>I feel, okay, that nylon rope thing, I was when I was ranking that, I was thinking, like, craters. Very cratery. 
685.3:>>Person1>>Yeah, that could actually be useful, I think. 
685.41:>>Person5>>Top ten.
685.96:>>Person4>>Yeah.
687.61:>>Person2>>Although, if we found 
687.68:>>Person3>>Very cratery place. 
689.96:>>Person2>>a crater. 
692.72:>>Person3>>Just walk around it? But again, ooh, see, like, it's a, say it's a really, like, long one. You know how? 
697.42:>>Person2>>But, or it could just be, like, deeper than fifty feet and then, like. 
701.46:>>Person1>>I would say it's probably better to have it than not have it, though. 
701.66:>>Person3>>Just, 
702.78:>>Person3>>just use the life raft to 
705.01:>>Person5>>But how are you going to carry all the stuff?
705.06:>>Person3>>slide down. 
705.25:>>Person4>>Well we can tie-
705.27:>>Person2>>But then, okay, also %HESITATION gravity. 
709.16:>>Person3>>It's not as. 
709.5:>>Person1>>One twelfth, I believe. 
710.72:>>Person4>>Like we can tie everybody together and even if the crater's deeper than fifty feet that would prevent people from falling in.
717.42:>>Person4>>Like so we wouldn't need to rescue, that would just be a precautionary thing.
718.6:>>Person2>>That's true, but we can fall like a hundred and twenty feet and it's like a ten foot drop if the gravity is, in fact, one twelfth. I would find, a fifty foot rope might as well be a five foot rope. 
730.38:>>Person2>>For the amount that it. 
730.5:>>Person4>>Because you can jump like- 
732.01:>>Person2>>because we can just jump. 
733.36:>>Person3>>So, wait. What do we have? One, two, three, four, five, six. 
733.5:>>Person4>>That's true.
736.06:>>Person2>>Alright, I didn't even think of that before. 
737.15:>>Person4>>But, it's still probably more useful than %HESITATION um, liferaft and parachute silk.
742.06:>>Person5>>Parachute silk.
745.47:>>Person2>>Yeah, I think we should take at least either parachute silk or life raft 
745.55:>>Person1>>I I mean. 
750.1:>>Person4>>I mean-
750.72:>>Person2>>for, like, some sort of, like. 
751.59:>>Person5>>What- what exactly is parachute silk? 
754.57:>>Person3>>See I, parachute silk is. 
754.72:>>Person2>>So, I assumed it was a full parachute's worth of parachute silk. As in, very thin, like. 
758.81:>>Person1>>Of just, like, flat fabric. 
760.56:>>Person4>>It's very strong.
761.38:>>Person5>>That's pointless though, right?
762.76:>>Person4>>But it's very strong.
765.14:>>Person2>>Yo, if the parachute's big enough. 
765.27:>>Person1>>I mean, like, I could, I could see using that for, like, carrying somebody if someone got hurt. But, like, again if they get hurt, I would imagine they're gonna, they're gonna die anyway, so. 
765.81:>>Person4>>It's stronger than a life raft. 
774.16:>>Person3>>Yeah just take off their 
776.14:>>Person4>>I'd just leave them.
776.29:>>Person3>>helmet while they're asleep. 
776.94:>>Person2>>Jesus. God damn. 
777.23:>>Person1>>I didn't mean it that way. 
778.02:>>Person4>>Well then we need the guns for the mercy killing.
780.85:>>Person3>>%HESITATION We don't, okay. Alright, alright, how about, alright, so we have one, two, three, four, five, six. What do you, so you guys, what do you guys feel about let's say? 
783.59:>>Person2>>Okay, let's move away from mercy killing. 
787.85:>>Person2>>Hey, if the parachute is big enough, then we can roll it up and have a fifty foot rope. 
794.7:>>Person3>>We could. %HESITATION Yeah, that's true. 
796.49:>>Person3>>Alright, signal flare.  
796.58:>>Person1>>Or cut it into strips and it will probably longer than fifty foot. And it will be longer than fifty feet. 
796.59:>>Person5>>True.
798.47:>>Person3>>Do you guys agree that the next two? 
798.55:>>Person2>>Yeah, and then, and tie the strips together. And then it's longer than fifty feet. If we cut a spiral pattern into it 
803.18:>>Person3>>That is true, if we cut it very, very small. 
805.13:>>Person2>>or just cut it into strips. 
808.0:>>Person3>>Alright, like, do you guys think the next two, like, something about signal flares or first aid kit? Or, like, what do you think? Alright, what do you think would be the next two priority out of the one, two, three, four, five, six, seven? Yeah. 
809.22:>>Person2>>Even if it's a twenty foot long parachute. 
820.78:>>Person4>>Are we gonna agree that compasses just don't work? 
821.35:>>Person1>>On the upper edge? 
823.55:>>Person5>>Yes. 
823.76:>>Person2>>If we'd like to agree on that, then let's just throw it at thirteen. 
824.7:>>Person1>>I think they don't, I think they don't work. Pretty sure. 
828.75:>>Person3>>Let's just throw it at thirteen then? Alright. 
830.3:>>Person2>>And we have the stellar map. 
830.97:>>Person4>>Okay.
831.17:>>Person3>>And, yeah, stellar, if we have stellar map, then we should be good with. 
833.51:>>Person2>>And we have the radio. 
835.15:>>Person3>>Yeah, I mean, that's how, yeah. That, 
836.4:>>Person2>>Or, well, receiver. 
837.16:>>Person3>>yeah. Plus. 
837.85:>>Person2>>Trans, oh it's a receiver-transmitter. 
838.05:>>Person1>>It's a, and, a receiver and a transmitter. 
839.78:>>Person3>>Ooh, that's, ooh, that's definitely that's three. 
839.82:>>Person2>>Oh, that's so good. It's so good. 
841.22:>>Person1>>Like that's just, that's OP. 
844.1:>>Person4>>Um.
844.67:>>Person2>>ABCDEFGHIJKLMN FM receiver-transmitter. 
845.55:>>Person3>>Let's see. 
848.67:>>Person3>>Alright. 
848.81:>>Person1>>Yes. %HESITATION
851.17:>>Person3>>One case of bee. Alright, what'd you guys think is the next, like, the next two things? 
854.49:>>Person1>>Next high priority thing? I would probably say, like, 
855.96:>>Person3>>Like, next top three things. 
857.51:>>Person1>>yeah, I would probably say signal flares. 
859.57:>>Person4>>Signal flares.
860.04:>>Person3>>Signal flares. 
861.76:>>Person3>>Would you say signal flares and then first aid kit? Or are you guys, like, against. 
864.18:>>Person5>>What would you use signal flares for? 
866.01:>>Person3>>That's the, the thing is, like, if say there's others, there's other ships, you know. We're not the only ones. 
866.82:>>Person4>>To contact the base. 
868.33:>>Person2>>I 
870.84:>>Person5>>How do signal flares work?
871.31:>>Person2>>I feel like we have an FM receiver-transmitter. 
873.25:>>Person4>>No, there's a base but we have an FM- 
875.58:>>Person2>>Like, 
875.94:>>Person1>>But would we know exactly where we are? Like, we can say, like, alright, come here for rescue and we know, like, maybe a general area. 
881.72:>>Person3>>Yeah, and then, yeah. I'd, like, signal flares just because there's nothing else in the. 
882.28:>>Person4>>That's true.
882.49:>>Person1>>But that might help, like, the final search. 
886.06:>>Person5>>Wait but how do- how do signal flares work? Don't you need oxygen to ignite?
889.27:>>Person3>>Well, they combust on their own. Yeah, they project up and then, yeah. 
889.45:>>Person2>>No, they're, like, they're self, they're they have all of the stuff in them. 
893.33:>>Person2>>I'm pretty, 
894.04:>>Person5>>So they have everything to operate it inside. 
894.53:>>Person2>>I'm pretty sure do signal, you, like, light signal flares definitely at the top of Everest. I know they're rated for that, I don't know. 
895.24:>>Person1>>Pretty sure they're,
899.02:>>Person1>>I'm pretty sure they're usually self oxidizing, or whatever. 
901.3:>>Person2>>Yeah. They. 
901.35:>>Person3>>Yeah. 
903.25:>>Person3>>%HESITATION
905.62:>>Person3>>Yeah we were. 
912.05:>>Person3>>I mean, honestly, all that stuff in the middle, though, the're kind of interchangeable.
